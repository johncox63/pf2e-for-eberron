        "value": "<p><em>Trained from the instant they were constructed, until the moment they were deployed, warforged were invented and born for war. As the war came to an end, warforged were recognized and granted their rights as humanoids by the Treaty of Thronehold. Now, they are soldiers whose only purpose has come to an end and must find meaning in a world that has abandoned them.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Warforged were created as expendable construct soldiers to fight in the last war. Early Cannith development of the warforged war focused on the production of warforged such as the warforged titans which were true constructs - machines of war built to destroy, kill, and die on command. With further refinements and arcane experimentation, the warforged evolved until they were a new type of creature - a living construct. This advancement in development was made possible by the creation forges but came with the side-effect of adding sentience to the new construct known only as warforged. However, with their single-minded focus and combat prowess, sentience empowered warforged with a desire to preserve themselves than Cannith's other mindless constructs exhibit - making them a more efficient soldier than simple golems.</p>\n<p>In the wake of the Last War, the Treaty of Thronehold has granted warforged their rights and freedom from being used as bought-and-sold soldiers of nations. This newfound freedom for warforged is a double-edged sword, as many warforged struggle to find a place in a world that no longer cares for them. Some warforged have taken up new employments as labourers and artisans; many warforged have taken on employment doing what they already know and fight fiercely as a soldier. The warforged that fight on have taken roles as guards, mercenaries, adventurers, and some have found their way back into the employment of armies. Warforged in these roles make steadfast allies and fearsome enemies. They fight with a vigour that most humanoids struggle to match - but with the ability to adapt and learn that mindless constructs can not replicate.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">You might\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have scars and wounds from fighting in the last war, dealing with old injuries and trauma that has never healed</li>\n<li>Often misread other creatures' emotions, struggling to understand their - and your own - feelings</li>\n<li>Apply wartime thinking to every situation, analyzing every situation as a tactical puzzle<br />\u00c2\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Others Probably\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe you do not experience emotions and are incapable of higher thinking beyond your programming</li>\n<li>Are an expendable asset, and to be taken advantage of for your tireless nature and lack of world experience outside the war</li>\n<li>See you as a valuable ally to have on the battlefield, even if sometimes they struggle to relate to you</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div class=\"bg-paper page d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Physical Description\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</h2>\n<p>Warforged appear to be a completely constructed creature. Their frame is composed of a composite of materials\u00e2\u20ac\u201dobsidian, iron, stone, darkwood, silver, and organic material. Around a warforged's frame is a musculature is composed of root-like cords infused with alchemical liquids that grant strength and surprising grace and flexibility to their body. Their exterior is covered in a series of flexible metallic or leather plates, creating a form of integrated armour which grants them protection on the battlefield. This integrated armour is attached directly into their body by the root-like tendrils of their musculature and is extremely painful to remove. Most warforged share a similar facial structure, with a hinged jaw and crystal eys embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. The specific composition and structure of each warforged changes depending on their intended purpose, but all warforged are humanoid in shape.</p>\n<p>Unique among constructs, warforged have learned to modify their bodies through magic and training. These unique changes that warforged choose helps define their personality and differentiate their physical form from one warforged from another.</p>\n<p>As constructs, warforged typically don't need to breathe, eat, or sleep; however, the body of a warforged needs to vent alchemical impurities at a constant rate. This venting process requires breathable air to prevent a buildup of impurities in a warforged's alchemical fluids which can seize a warforged's biological components, sometimes to fatal effect. Thus, warforged can still suffocate much like living creatures, but can in a limited sense hold their breath as other humanoid creatures can. Though they don't sleep, warforged require a period of restoration to allow the alchemical fluids of their body to replenish. Without this process, a warforged is incapable of fully restoring their body and they enter an inefficient state (similar to a humanoid who doesn't get 8 hours of sleep).</p>\n<p>Warforged were created by Cannith within the last 30 years, and as a result, their life expectancy is unknown. Older warforged have begun to show signs of physical decay, indicating that they may eventually degrade. Though it is still unclear (and Cannith has never provided a clear answer), it appears that warforged may have innate souls. A warforged's body is as vulnerable to destruction as any other creature's body is, and warforged that have been destroyed require magical intervention such as resurrection magic to restore themselves.</p>\n<p>As constructs, warforged have no concept of gender - nor is their body designed to a specific gendered shape. Though some warforged have selected a gender identity, most warforged are unaware or choose to ignore the concept altogether.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Society\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</h2>\n<p>Warforged were created as soldiers to fight in the last war, and have only gained their freedom within the last two years. As a result, warforged do not have any established cultures or traditions, or any sort of developed place in society. Most warforged have picked up the culture of the nation they fought for, and others have latched on to bits and pieces that interest them creating a mixed celebration of traditions. Since most warforged struggle to relate to other humanoids, most of the time they will band together with other warforged who provide a sense of familiarity. Sometimes this group is those they fought with in the last war, other times it is simply others like them who decided to settle in the local area.</p>\n<p>Sometimes warforged prefer to lead solitary lives or work to integrate themselves into other humanoid societies. Some warforged wander Khorvaire, looking to find purpose and meaning for themselves and have become ambassadors between cultures.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"bg-paper page d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"page-overlay\">\u00c2\u00a0</div>\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Alignment and Religion\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</h2>\n<p>Warforged tend to be neutrally aligned. As constructs of war, they were built to fight without questioning orders - though they are capable of doing so. Warforged are capable of emotion and moral reasoning, however, this is something few were trained or practised in and most struggle to comprehend.</p>\n<p>Warforged similarly tend to be unreligious. As a soldier some warforged have picked up the religion of their humanoid companions, beginning the follow the Sovereign Host as a soldier of Cyre, or the Silver Flame as a Thranish soldier, but independently most have not been drawn to religion. Warforged that have begun to follow a religion have sometimes found an answer to the questions of their existence and their purpose in life, but these warforged are few between.</p>\n<p>Some warforged have begun to be drawn towards a messianic figure called the Lord of Blades. The Lord of Blades has begun to gather a cult-like following of warforged by promising purpose to the disaffected and a rebellion against the \"weak-fleshed\" ancestries.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Names\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</h2>\n<p>Most warforged do not have a name for themselves beyond their creation number such as unit 4859. Only after being able to experience the world outside of military structure have they begun to understand the need of other races to have names for everything. Many warforged accept any name that others give them, and warforged working in proximity to other humanoids are often are referred to by nicknames. Some warforged, however, have come to see having a name as a defining moment of their new existence, and thus search long and hard for the perfect name to attach to themselves.</p>\n<h3>Sample warforged names</h3>\n<p>Anchor, Banner, Bastion, Blade, Blue, Bow, Cart, Church, Crunch, Crystal, Dagger, Dent, Five, Glaive, Hammer, Iron, Lucky, Mace, Oak, Onyx, Pants, Pierce, Red, Rod, Rusty, Scout, Seven, Shield, Slash, Smith, Spike, Temple, Vault, Wall<br />\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Integrated Armor</h2>\n<p>Your heritage grants you one type of integrated armour, as noted below. If your integrated armour becomes destroyed, it no longer grants an item bonus to your AC but remains integrated into your body. However, your destroyed integrated armour can still be repaired at a very hard DC for its level, losing the destroyed condition when its HP is above 0.</p>\n<h3>Nominal Integrated Armour</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron.HgXZdbadXiYimkFc]{Nominal Integrated Armour}</p>\n<p>Your body does not have the armour protections afforded to most other warforged. Though you are still physically wearing integrated armour, you are considered unarmored. Your integrated armour is in the leather armour group and has a Dex cap of +5. This armour has no bulk, but you can never wear other armour or remove your integrated armour; however, you still don't become fatigued from sleeping. Finally, you can etch armour runes onto your armour as normal.</p>\n<h3>Light Integrated Armour</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron.IG7IDR71E2lMEiuJ]{Light Integrated Armour}</p>\n<p>Your body is designed to be agile with some protection. Your integrated armour is light armour in the leather armour group that grants a +2 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +3, a check penalty of \u00e2\u20ac\u201c1, and a Strength value of 12. This armour has no bulk, but you can never wear other armour or remove your integrated armour; however, you still don't become fatigued from sleeping. Finally, you can etch armour runes onto your armour as normal.</p>\n<h3>Medium Integrated Armour</h3>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron.hPqgIyJlnJmUx0Qt]{Medium Integrated Armour}</p>\n<p>Your body is designed to be particularly resilient. Your integrated armour is medium armour in the plate armour group that grants a +4 item bonus to AC, a Dex cap of +1, a check penalty of \u00e2\u20ac\u201c2, a speed penalty of \u00e2\u20ac\u201c5 feet, and a Strength value of 16. This armour has no bulk, but you can never wear other armour or remove your integrated armour; however, you still don't become fatigued from sleeping.
