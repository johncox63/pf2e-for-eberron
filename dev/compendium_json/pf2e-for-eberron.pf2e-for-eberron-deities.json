        "value": "<p>Druidism originated in Khorvaire sixteen thousand years ago when Vvaraak, a black dragon (although some sources claim she is green), foretold a great planar invasion. In order to aid the humanoids in repelling this invasion she taught the first orc druids of the bond between the three progenitor dragons as well as how to tap into that power and use it to seal gates to other planes. These original druids are still known as the Gatekeepers and continue to protect Khorvaire from invasions of aberrations from other planes.</p>\n<p>Although the Eldeen Reaches often comes to mind when thinking of druids and druidism there are druids all across Khorvaire and indeed across Eberron and even in other planes of existence. Anywhere the wild calls one can find druids of every species. Druidism is common among the lizardfolk of Q'barra as well as among the fey in Thelanis even the drow among the ruins of Xen'drik hold to ancient druidic traditions. Whether these were also taught to them by dragons, or if the power was discovered through other means is not yet known.</p>\n<p>Virtually all followers of the Green Faith are druids that belong to the various circles described in @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-lore.t2gDJ56vdmc0Cnwt.JournalEntryPage.qHmMbPDXJeucS1sQ]{The Druidic Sects} journal entry.
