In order to complete the dungeon, an adventurer completes each of the floors in order, earning rewards as they do so. For most awakened dungeons, the floors are reflective of some aspect of the dungeon’s inner self, soul, hidden past, or some other secret. Whether the dungeon manifested a personality first and the floors changed to suit their inner self, or their inner selves were shaped by the floors, is a question as difficult to determine as the chicken and the egg.<br>An awakened dungeon can send their avatar in and out of their own extradimensional dungeon in order to challenge a floor of the dungeon through a process that takes an hour of concentration. They can additionally bring along allies, as long as they are all holding hands or otherwise physically connected in a circle throughout the process. It’s always possible to leave the dungeon this way, but the ability to enter is much more limited. Normally, a dungeon and its allies can only enter the dungeon to challenge one of the floors from a safe, stable location after a full day of rest. The GM might determine that the dungeon’s avatar is able to enter the dungeon under other circumstances as well. After spending an hour without making further progress on the floor, the dungeon’s group automatically retreats and leaves the dungeon. They also leave the dungeon after clearing a dungeon floor. When this happens, an awakened dungeon and any allies they brought are sent back to the same spot where they entered the dungeon. Additionally, if the dungeon’s avatar dies, the dungeon loses all consciousness, and it ejects any remaining allies, as well as the avatar’s corpse, back to the Material Plane.<br>A dungeon’s denizens at first bear no loyalty to the dungeon’s avatar, and so challenging a floor is dangerous even to the dungeon’s own adventuring party.
