Stories speak of bugbears as great hairy beasts that lurk in the shadows - it is the bugbears that lie in the darkness undetected, waiting for the children that strayed off the beaten path or too far from their parents, or for the villagers wandering out at night away from their homes. They drag the foolish and unsuspecting to their den to be devoured alive; worse, if they cut off your head, your soul is bound to Eberron and can never reach Dolurrh. <br><br><br>These terrible and fearsome stories flowered from small seeds of truth. Most bugbears, despite their size, rely on stealth and the cover of night to surprise their enemies - expending great bursts of energy to end fights before the victim can react. However, bugbears themselves are no more likely to eat other humanoids than humans themselves. The true bugbears of the forest, unlike those expected from human folklore, tend towards peace and the flow of nature rather than violence. After the Last War, many more stories of stoic bugbear rangers or druids guiding lost troops to safety through impossible terrain have been retold by soldiers. <br><br><br>Alongside this, new stories of bugbears are being forged by Darguun, a nation that rose from the ashes of the Last War. There are also many stories yet untold of the militant bugbears belonging to the secretive Dhakaani Empire. ",

            "description": "Known under the moniker of \"The Children of Jes\", changelings are humanoid creatures with shape-changing abilities. In particular, their abilities allow them to take the form of other humanoid creatures with little limitation on who. Many use their gifts as a form of artistic expression or to convey their current emotional state, adopting certain personas depending on the context of their moods. However, it does not go unnoticed by many, including some changelings themselves, that their ability is an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and those whose aims are to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with general suspicion.<br><br>Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler. Wherever humans live, changelings reside also; the question is whether they make their presence known.<br><br>A persona is known as the faces and personalities each changeling chooses to adopt - based on where changelings are born their personas are likely to vary. A changeling born in an isolated community might only possess one persona that they developed, using a single face as they exist on Khorvaire, while those belonging to a community of changelings will have multiple personas and perhaps come to share them with one another, each being \"Tamirin the Traveling Seamstress\" on different days of the week.",

            "description": "Shifters are a diverse ancestry that combines the traits of humanoid and beast heritage, not unlike a were-creature. At a young age, each shifter discovers their beast within, which comes to define who they are as a person. With the ability to draw on their inherent beast to temporarily shift into a more animalistic version of themselves, they are sometimes also referred to as the were-touched. While some believe shifters are the descendants of werecreatures, the opposite is true. The first werecreatures to plague Khorvaire are said to be shifters who were cursed with great evil. Shifters are unrelated to modern werecreatures and are a distinct ancestry of Eberron with unique cultures and traditions.<br><br>Despite the distinction between shifters and werecreatures, shifters were persecuted during the fifty-year crusade against werecreatures less than two centuries ago. Targeted by the crusaders who fought against the rising lycanthrope tide, many innocent shifters were killed in the crusade to eliminate the threat. Since then, most shifters across Khorvaire prefer to live in enclaves or districts of other shifters - avoiding other ancestries which may still bear them ill will.",

            "description": "<i>Trained from the instant they were constructed, until the moment they were deployed, warforged were invented and born for war. As the war came to an end, warforged were recognized and granted their rights as humanoids by the Treaty of Thronehold. Now, they are soldiers whose only purpose has come to an end and must find meaning in a world that has abandoned them.</i><br><br>Warforged were created as expendable construct soldiers to fight in the last war. Early Cannith development of the warforged war focused on the production of warforged such as the warforged titans which were true constructs - machines of war built to destroy, kill, and die on command. With further refinements and arcane experimentation, the warforged evolved until they were a new type of creature - a living construct. This advancement in development was made possible by the creation forges but came with the side-effect of adding sentience to the new construct known only as warforged. However, with their single-minded focus and combat prowess, sentience empowered warforged with a desire to preserve themselves than Cannith's other mindless constructs exhibit - making them a more efficient soldier than simple golems.<br><br>In the wake of the Last War, the Treaty of Thronehold has granted warforged their rights and freedom from being used as bought-and-sold soldiers of nations. This newfound freedom for warforged is a double-edged sword, as many warforged struggle to find a place in a world that no longer cares for them. Some warforged have taken up new employments as laborers and artisans; many warforged have taken on employment doing what they already know and fight fiercely as a soldier. The warforged that fight on have taken roles as guards, mercenaries, adventurers, and some have found their way back into the employment of armies. Warforged in these roles make steadfast allies and fearsome enemies. They fight with a vigor that most humanoids struggle to match - but with the ability to adapt and learn that mindless constructs can not replicate.",
