The people of Khorvaire have followed the Sovereigns for thousands of years, and everyone knows the names of the Sovereigns and the Dark Six. Even people who aren’t devout might still swear by the Sovereigns or offer a prayer in a moment of crisis.</p><p>The Sovereign Host is wondrously diverse. Variations and subsects of the faith thrive, and temples are only loosely aligned. In a small community, a skilled smith might double as the priest because people believe he’s close to Onatar. A midwife might symbolically speak for Arawai and Boldrei. Typically, the faithful are united by their shared beliefs; no central authority seeks to enforce a singular creed.</p><p>The Sovereign Host is a group of nine deities collec­tively representing the entire world, but focusing on aspects of civilization—community, the protection of the weak, the slaying of wild beasts, fertility, construc­tion, and the like. The Sovereign Host is the most widely worshiped body in Khorvaire. Nearly everyone offers prayers to the Host as a whole and to individual deities for specific actions. For example, a farmer might whisper a prayer of thanks to Arawai when his baby is born healthy, and a blacksmith might sing the songs of Onatar when working at her forge.</p><h1>Foundations of the Faith</h1><p>Followers of the Sovereign Host are generally called Vassals, but despite the shared name, they are anything but monolithic. Variations of the Sovereign Host can be found across Eberron in many different cultures—the Pyrinean Creed of humanity, the Rushemé faith of the giants of Xen’drik, the Cazhaak traditions of Droaam. Precise names and groupings change, but the faith’s basic principles remain the same.</p><h2>Distant yet Omnipresent</h2><p>The Sovereigns don’t walk the world. No one expects to meet Dol Dorn in the flesh. To do so would, in fact, be unnecessary and limiting. You don’t expect to meet Dol Dorn because you know he is with you every time a blade is drawn, ready to guide your hand. Aureon watches over the wizard studying magic and the judge presiding in court. The Devourer is present in every storm, and you can’t fight him any more than you can defeat an earthquake with a sword. A true Vassal doesn’t need proof of the Sovereigns’ existence for the world itself is the proof.</p><p>With that said, many myths depict the Sovereigns in the flesh, performing heroic acts and setting particular elements of creation in motion. These myths are set during the Age of Demons, and Vassal doctrine maintains that the Sovereigns defeated and bound the fiendish overlords. As the overlords previously ruled reality, once they were defeated, the Sovereigns ascended to fill that role. So there are stories of Dol Dorn performing tremendous feats of strength, and you might find an artifact said to be Onatar’s hammer; but these date back to a mythic age when they were champions, not yet true Sovereigns.</p><p>Every culture depicts the Sovereigns in different ways. The giants depict them as giants while the Pyrinean Creed depicts them as humans. Many cultures use draconic imagery to represent the Sovereigns. But since the Sovereigns don’t manifest physically, any representation of them is purely symbolic. Dol Dorn is the Warrior, Onatar is the Smith—any image that clearly depicts these concepts will do.</p><h2>A Personal Experience</h2><p>The Sovereigns are everywhere, offering guidance to anyone who will listen. Due to the personal nature of this faith, it doesn’t have the same degree of organization and hierarchy as the Silver Flame. A large community generally has an eightsided temple to the Sovereign Host, staffed by full-time priests. In smaller villages and towns, there might be an untended shrine or a local person who is considered to be especially close to a Sovereign and performs ceremonies. In the town of Riverford, the innkeeper Dara is said to speak with Boldrei’s voice; she’s the pillar of the community, and people come to her with their problems and disputes.</p><p>A Sovereign priest’s role isn’t simply as an intermediary to the divine; anyone can talk to the Sovereigns. Instead, priests offer guidance and clarity, helping you understand the path you’re on. A temple or priest often serves another function beyond their religious duties; the Great Hall of Aureon in Sharn is a library as well as a temple, while you might find a shrine to Kol Korran at the center of the public market. Priests serve as teachers, mediators, and guides, but they are often also subject matter experts in the path tied to the Sovereign they serve. In creating a Vassal character, think about your personal relationship to the Sovereigns. Who do you feel particularly close to? Do you feel you are blessed or directly guided by a Sovereign? Is there a point in your life where you believe one of the Sovereigns intervened on your behalf?</p><h2>The Founding Faith</h2><p>When human settlers came from Sarlona, they brought the Sovereign Host with them. While some traditions have evolved over the course of centuries and civilizations, the Pyrinean interpretation of the Sovereigns is part of the very foundation of the Five Nations, and its creed is reflected in their values. You should follow the laws (Aureon) and value the traditions of your community (Boldrei). Industry (Onatar) and commerce (Kol Korran) are encouraged, though greed (the Keeper) is not. On the battlefield, you should fight with courage (Dol Dorn) and honor (Dol Arrah), while not engaging in needless cruelty (the Mockery). You should trust in Aureon’s laws and not take vengeance into your own hands (the Fury).</p><p>Beyond these basic values, the Sovereigns are ubiquitous in the Five Nations. When you go into a courtroom, you stand on an Eye of Aureon. Standard marriage ceremonies invoke Boldrei. Many people aren’t devoted Vassals and don’t actually believe the Sovereigns are guiding their every action. But even such pragmatists recall the names of each Sovereign, know many of their songs, and will celebrate Wildnight or Boldrei’s Feast. By and large, if you live in the Five Nations, it’s assumed you’re a Vassal unless you specifically say you’re not.</p><h2>Endless Diversity</h2><p>The giants of Xen’drik raised temples to Ourelon Lawbringer long before humanity embraced Aureon, the Sovereign of Law and Lore. Hunters in Aundair give thanks to Balinor, but orcs in the Shadow Marches invoke Baalkan the Beastlord, while the Talenta halflings tell stories of clever Bally-Nur.</p><p>Some of this is a natural process of syncretism. The Marcher orcs blended their original beliefs with the traditions of human settlers. But the Talenta were telling their stories before they ever encountered humanity. Though scholars debate the reason why, most agree that the more similar a tradition is to an archetypal Sovereign, the easier it is to draw divine power from that faith. A culture that invokes a deity of the hunt is more likely to produce clerics and paladins than a culture that worships a giant salmon of the same name—and if the deity’s name is similar to “Balinor,” the connection to divine magic will be easier still. Vassals sages assert that this proves the existence of the Sovereigns, while skeptics say it could simply be a numbers game—it’s easier to draw power from a shared belief, and belief in the Sovereigns has reached critical mass.</p><p>Because of this diversity, Vassal priests are rarely concerned with heresy. Those who follow the Pyrinean Creed may attempt to correct what they see as flawed beliefs, but ultimately, most just smile at the ignorance of the Marcher orc, content in the knowledge that they know the proper names of the Sovereigns. Likewise, while player characters and NPCs may choose to follow one of the paths described below, you can always develop a unique twist on tradition or introduce a new cult that worships a specific grouping of Sovereigns. This openness is also reflected in Vassal interactions with the Church of the Silver Flame. The Pyrinean Creed asserts that the Sovereigns defeated the overlords at the dawn of time; if the Silver Flame is what keeps the overlords bound, presumably the Sovereigns created it. So there’s no inherent conflict; rather, a Vassal will simply shrug and say, “But why do you worship a cage?”</p><h1>Paths of the Faith</h1><p>The Sovereigns are worshiped in many different configurations and forms. A particular community could be devoted to a single Sovereign, or it could present a Sovereign and member of the Dark Six as being allied forces (as seen with the Restful Watch). A few of the best-known variants are described below.</p><h2>The Pyrinean Creed</h2><p>The standard names and attributes of the Sovereigns and Six — Aureon, Balinor, the Shadow — are drawn from the Pyrinean Creed, the dominant tradition within the Five Nations. This is the source of the Octogram symbol, the division of Nine and Six, and holy days like Boldrei’s Feast. If you follow the Pyrinean Creed, you believe in the orthodox faith of the Sovereigns. You recognize all of the Sovereigns and Six, even if you may feel that one in particular is especially influential in your life.</p><p>While the common faithful know the term “Pyrinean Creed,” its history is largely only of interest to scholars and priests. A typical Vassal might know that they believe in the Pyrinean Creed, but if you asked five of them what Pyrine was, you’d get five different answers—“He was a legendary missionary!” “It was an old town in Daskara where there was a council!” In reality, these beliefs were codified thousands of years ago in the Sarlonan nation of Pyrine, then carried to Khorvaire by human settlers. While Pyrine was assimilated by the Empire of Riedra over a thousand years ago and its people no longer worship the Sovereign Host, their legacy lives on in Khorvaire.</p><h2>The Church of the Wyrm Ascendant</h2><p>The Church of the Wyrm Ascendant worships the Sovereigns in the same groupings and names as the Pyrinean Creed. However, the church asserts that the champions who fought the overlords were dragons, depicting them as such. The church is very focused on wealth and economic power; members are expected to contribute to the hoard of their local temple, and the priests often engage in behavior that outsiders might consider to be corrupt. They hold the unorthodox belief that mortals can ascend to become Sovereigns themselves - that by emulating a particular Sovereign, a mortal can eventually take their place. Popular rumor holds that the founder of the Library of Korranberg, Dorius Alyre ir’Korran, built the library as part of a quest to assume the mantle of Aureon. While this Sovereign ascension is believed to occur after death, some priests teach that devoted members - especially those who donate great sums to the temple hoard - can actually become dragons in life. While this seems unlikely, it could be an interesting background for a Draconic Bloodline sorcerer; it’s not that you have draconic ancestry, but rather, due to your devotion, you appear to be evolving into a dragon.</p><p>Wyrm Ascendant Vassals believe the dragons themselves are divine tools and emissaries of the Sovereigns and Six, though few dragons have ever acknowledged the church in any way. It’s thought that the dragons themselves follow a form of this faith known as Thir - Draconic for “three” - but the traditions of Argonnessen are rarely revealed to people of Khorvaire. The Wyrm Ascendant is strongest in Aundair and Zilargo, though it remains an obscure sect, and has noteworthy temples in Stormreach, Korranberg, and Fairhaven.</p><h2>The Restful Watch</h2><p>Priests of the Restful Watch specialize in embalming, funerals, and cemetery maintenance. They can be found in every major city in the Five Nations, and even smaller towns may have a devotee of the Watch tending the boneyard. The Restful Watch maintains that the souls of the dead pass through Dolurrh into the realm of the Sovereigns—unless they are snatched by the Keeper’s greedy talons. One of a priest’s most important duties is helping bereaved choose appropriate grave goods or sacrifices sufficient to distract the Keeper and ensure the deceased’s soul reaches Dolurrh. For a simple person with few achievements, a single coin might suffice. But the more remarkable the deceased, the greater interest the Keeper will have in their soul—requiring a more significant sacrifice to distract him.</p><p>Faithful of the Watch rarely discuss another aspect of their faith with outsiders—that once a soul rises to the realm of the Sovereigns, it can never return. The Restful Watch believes that if Aureon knows that a dead hero will be needed in the future, he has the Keeper snatch the soul before it reaches Dolurrh, so it can be restored when the time is right. Thus, while the Restful Watch primarily reveres Aureon, they also understand and respect the Keeper, and believe that he serves a vital purpose.</p><p>Two other roles within the Restful Watch could be interesting options for a player character. The Restful Watch believes that Aureon is preserving the souls of heroes in preparation for an apocalyptic conflict that lies ahead. It’s said that this will involve the collapse of the Silver Flame and the subsequent unleashing of the dreadful overlords. You may have been sent out in the world to watch for signs that this conflict is coming to pass; this could require you to investigate the Mournland or clash with the Lords of Dust.</p><p>The Restful Watch also occasionally identifies people they believe Aureon has marked as a hero whose soul will be preserved. This could be one of your fellow adventurers—and as an acolyte or sage of the Restful Watch, you’ve been assigned to follow this person around, chronicling their life and making sure to perform the appropriate rituals when they die. “Don’t mind me, I’m just going to follow you around until your heroic death. Trust me, you’re going to accomplish amazing things!”</p><h1>The Schism</h1><p>Everyone familiar with the scriptures of the Sovereign Host knows that they once formed a single pantheon with the Dark Six. The Host eventually banished the Six for their evil ways and constant schemes against the other gods. This sundering of the Host is called the Schism, the Divine Fall, or the Celestial Exile. Some theorists hold that the rape of Arawai by the Devourer triggered the Schism, but other legends suggest that this event took place long after the split.</p><p>Scholars among Vassals and various religious institutions debate what the Schism actually means. After all, the Dark Six are no less gods now than they were before their banishment. They still hold sway over many aspects of the world, and some Vassals still pray to them under certain circumstances. Clearly, the Sovereign Host lacked the means (or the desire) to strip the Six of their divinity. The Schism, then, is more along the lines of a familial division, one branch disowning and disavowing the other. It represents the efforts of the Host to distance themselves, and their worshipers, from their darker counterparts. While scripture describes this as punishment, some scholars believe that the Host wished to remove the Dark Six’s access to the population of Vassals, minimizing their ability to do further harm.</p><p>Scripture and scholars differ on what caused the conflict between the two factions of the original Host. Even the most ancient texts, whose doctrine reportedly predates the Schism, refer to the pantheon as Nine and Six and One. So even before the official split, the two groups were at least partly independent of each other. For centuries, Vassals assumed that this division was one of good against evil, which supports the currently accepted view.</p><p>Recent religious theory, however, suggests an alternative division, as well as another interpretation of the Schism itself. Of all the nine gods of the Sovereign Host, only two - Arawai and Balinor - hold dominion over natural aspects of the world. The others hold sway, partly or in whole, over elements of civilization and culture. Similarly, of the Dark Six, only two hold dominion over concepts native to civilization: The Mockery represents treachery and dishonor, while the Traveler is the lord of deception. The other four oversee aspects of the natural world or magic, completely independent of civilized practice. Some scholars and priests believe that the “Nine and Six” do not refer to the current division of the Host and the Dark Six, but rather nine gods of civilization and six gods of the wild. Similarly, these theorists maintain, the Schism was not the result of good defeating evil, but rather the struggle between the civilized and the savage for the future of mortals. In this conflict, they maintain, Arawai and Balinor sided with the gods of civilization for the sake of mortals, while the Mockery and the Traveler sided with the gods of the wild due to their enmity with many of the civilized deities. On a symbolic level, then, the Sovereign Host will dominate the world, and hold greater power than do the Dark Six, for so long as civilization thrives. Should the mortal races ever fall back into barbarism, however - as some feared would happen during the Last War - the Dark Six might well rise to ascendancy.</p><p>By an extension of this reasoning, then, the Sovereign Host holds no true grudge against the Dark Six, any more than a cliff holds a grudge against the seas or the winds that pound at it. Rather, the Schism was an attempt by Vassals to distance their patrons from the death and destruction caused by the Dark Six and the nastier forces of nature.</p><h1>The Host in Everyday Life</h1><p>As might be expected of a faith that proclaims the gods’ presence in all aspects of the world, Vassals practice their religion throughout the day, regardless of activity. The precise degree of observance depends on the devotion of the individual: The average practitioner prays many times per day, and even conducts minor rites more than once.</p><p>For instance, on a typical morning, a Vassal might offer a brief prayer on awakening, simply to give thanks for the new day. If she has an important endeavor ahead of her, if it is the holy day of one of her patron gods, or if she happens to be unusually devout, the morning observance might take the form of a minor rite. Prayers to start each meal are common, as are prayers or minor rites upon first embarking on the day’s work. Particularly devoted Vassals might perform individual rites throughout the day when beginning specific tasks, but for most, a general request for good fortune at work suffices.</p><p>Come evening, Vassals give thanks for the events of the day; even if the day has gone poorly, tradition demands that they find something positive in it, as a reminder that nothing the gods have created is entirely bad. If this is a holy day, a Vassal traditionally performs longer rites in the evening (though she might have done so earlier in the day, if circumstances warranted). At bedtime, she might undertake a final minor rite requesting a peaceful sleep and the opportunity for a new day tomorrow.</p><p>This summary makes it seem as though Vassals spend an enormous portion of each day in prayer and ritual. This is not so. Each such activity rarely takes longer than a few minutes. Only truly important festivals, such as the evening rite on a god’s holy day, last for even an hour. The average prayer of thanks might involve nothing more than a few sentences, reverently uttered, and even most minor rites take no longer than the time necessary to light the appropriate flames and burn the appropriate sacrifices. While zealous Vassals might indeed engage in hours of prayer, most spend less than half an hour per day in total doing so, excepting holidays. Despite their brief duration, because the observances are spread throughout the day, they remind the faithful of their daily interactions with the divine all around them and keep the gods in their thoughts.</p><h1>The People of the Sovereign Host</h1><p>Because Vassals consider their faith to be a universal religion, equally applicable to all who wish to embrace it, they do not seek out a specific type of person for proselytizing or conversion. All are welcome, so long as they acknowledge the divine in the world around them and accept the Sovereign Host as the highest gods (and even the latter is somewhat flexible).</p><p>Worship of the Sovereign Host appeals most to people who live relatively standard lives. This doesn’t mean commoners only—a ruler’s life can be average as easily as a farmer’s. It’s simply that the daily tasks are different. Rather, the Sovereign Host attracts individuals whose lives do not point them in a specific direction. Those who believe, or want to believe, that the world has a fixed purpose, that someone is in control (even if they do not always understand the will or the actions of this guiding power) are particularly drawn to the Sovereign Host.</p><p>The Host holds dominion over most aspects of civilized life, so anyone who lives in such a state is likely to at least acknowledge the faith. Matters such as alignment and even profession have only minimal bearing on this worship. A farmer reveres Arawai, whether he’s neutral good or chaotic evil in his heart, because she provides his crops. Even if they do not worship her specifically, everyone benefits from Arawai’s grace—who doesn’t eat bread or potatoes, after all?—and so the vast majority of people offer her at least some thanks.</p><p>In sum, the Sovereign Host is the religion of choice for most people of western Khorvaire who do not have active reason to select a different religion. Longstanding tradition and the ubiquitous and accepting nature of the faith make it easy to slip into, and simple to practice.</p><h1>The Sovereign Host and Government</h1><p>The priesthood of the Sovereign Host makes no overt attempts to control governments, but they are not without influence. At least three of the Five Nations are Host-dominant, leaving little doubt that their leaders too worship the Sovereign Host. Thus, even if the priesthood does not try to sway a ruler’s decisions, her actions are unlikely to threaten the dominance of the faith and its priests.</p><p>On a local level, influence is far more overt. Mayors, town councils, governors, barons, even dukes might well belong to a congregation of Vassals and see the high priest as an authority figure. Most nobles have a religious advisor on staff to aid them in matters of faith and history. Influential religious officials can easily manipulate their advice and information for the benefit of the priesthood—or themselves. In many small communities, religious leaders are community leaders as well. The best do not take advantage of one to advance their position in the other, but more than a few ambitious priests see the title of reeve or mayor as just another stepping stone to power.</p><p>It is rare, but in some communities the priesthood of the Sovereign Host works in opposition to the secular government. This situation occurs most often in Thrane, where a minority beholden to the Host dwell in the midst of a theocracy of the Silver Flame. Vassals are sometimes persecuted in these areas, not necessarily by violent or overt means but through more subtle techniques such as price-gouging, shoddy goods, and poor service. Here as elsewhere, the Host’s priesthood does not oppose local governments directly. Instead priests encourage Vassals to support one another, to convert others, to attain positions of authority so they can improve their companions’ lives, and to protest mistreatment so that the government acts to quell it (if only to save face).</p><p>In some nations, worship of the Host—or certain members of the pantheon—is actively restricted. The monsters of Droaam do not hate the Host with the same passion they reserve for the Silver Flame, but they do react with hostility to overt displays of the faith within the small human and shifter populations. Although the goblinoids of Darguun have recently been introduced to the Host, the faith is taking hold very slowly. Some communities revere Balinor, Dol Arrah, and Dol Dorn but are still suspicious of the rest; others still worship the Shadow or the Mockery exclusively. In such areas, overt worship of the Sovereign Host, or “inappropriate” members of it, might result in persecution, imprisonment, conversion by the sword, or even execution.</p><p>In areas of oppression, the priesthood conducts Host ceremonies in secret, their shrines hidden in the wild or inside unassuming structures. They preach active resistance against the government, but through subtle techniques rather than visible uprisings that would surely be crushed. Leaders and officers who persecute Vassals might wind up short on supplies, for instance, or the victims of “accidents” such as unexplained fires. Meanwhile, the Vassals carefully feel out those in power for any sympathetic to their cause, or possible candidates for conversion.</p><h1>The Sovereign Host and Other Faiths</h1><p>In terms of overall influence, the Sovereign Host has little to fear from other faiths. Even with the modern growth of the Silver Flame and the schism that ejected the Dark Six, Vassals still make up a majority of the civilized population. The faith has even spread, albeit slowly and piecemeal, to the goblins of Darguun and the rural communities of the Eldeen Reaches. It maintains dominance, not through violence or intimidation, nor through promises of rewards in this world or the next, but through a much simpler process: integration.</p><p>Repeatedly throughout history, Vassals have come to a region, observed local religious practice—perhaps honoring spirits, now-unknown gods, or ancestors—and immediately set about incorporating that worship into the local practices of the Sovereign Host. For instance, Vassals’ current funerary rites were adopted thousands of years ago from a culture that worshiped its ancestors, not unlike the elves of Aerenal. The intent of the original rite was to introduce the newly deceased to the spirits of the dead, who were said to linger in crowds. Adding sacrifices of thanks made the ritual fit into preexisting Vassal practices.</p><p>By assimilating local traditions and adjusting their meaning to match the precepts of the Sovereign Host, Vassals make conversion easier. Few religions explain everything about the world. The gods’ presence in all things provides a perfect opening to proselytize. An isolated tribe might believe in its own gods or spirits, while inhabitants of another valley are governed by an entirely different set of divinities. Vassals take this opportunity to explain that the Sovereign Host encompasses all and that the spirits the tribesfolk venerate are real and worthy aspects of that Host.</p><h2>Specific Attitudes</h2><p>Given the wide range of Vassals across the many nations, communities, and social strata, it’s difficult to summarize their attitudes toward members of other religions. The attitudes presented below are simply the most common, stereotypical ideas of the average Vassal. As many disagree with these notions as share them.</p><ul><li>The Dark Six: Vile gods, worshiped by vile people. Of course, I might utter a prayer to the Devourer now and then, but that’s just to keep his wrath far from me. I most certainly don’t revere him the way these villains do!</li><li>The Silver Flame: They mean well, for certain. But their rigid worldview and intolerance leave them open to corruption, and make even the best of them difficult to deal with. If they would just acknowledge that the Silver Flame is a pale reflection of Dol Arrah, they would be happier and better off.</li><li>Druid Sects: They’re so close, but they fail to grasp the essence of the world. Worship of the natural world is worship of the Sovereign Host—they simply haven’t yet come to that realization.</li><li>The Blood of Vol: Delusional zealots who have placed their faith in false promises of immortality and vile perversions of the natural order. Some are truly evil, most merely misled, but all should be shown the error of their ways.</li><li>Other Sects: It’s astounding to me that anyone could place their faith in lesser beings, such as fallen angels or demon lords or dragons, when the gods so clearly stand above them. I am comforted only by the fact that the Sovereign Host brought most of these entities into being, so such worship still honors them, if only indirectly.</li></ul><h1>The Sovereign Host in the Last War</h1><p>The priesthood of the Sovereign Host took no unified stance during the Last War. For the most part, Vassals and even priests fought alongside their compatriots against enemies among the Five Nations. Whether one’s foes were fellow Vassals or not was meaningless; only their nationality mattered.</p><p>For most of the war, the liturgical councils continued to meet. They avoided issues of the war, for they knew that bringing up such matters could only cause dissension. Instead, they continued to focus on issues of the faith, interpreting scripture, determining the effect of the war on religious practice, and similar concerns.</p><p>The effects of the Last War still linger among the followers of the Sovereign Host. Given the loss of friendly contact between nations during the war, the customs of individual communities became ever more insular. At present, only the most basic similarities exist. A common theme of Host services in the modern day is forgiveness and the reforging of bonds to counter national and regional hatred that still lingers.</p><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"The Silver Flame","type":"text","_id":"XJnw6cYezlHVPAC4","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>Eberron is just one bad day away from collapsing into a demonic apocalypse.

This is a world where deadly supernatural evil is a concrete fact of existence, and the church itself was founded when a noble paladin gave her life to pull her nation back from the abyss. Some might mistakenly see the church merely as a militant hierarchical religious organization and assume that it must be a force of oppression. But while the Church of the Silver Flame is a religion, it’s equally a volunteer militia whose members are prepared to risk their lives to protect every innocent from the real and deadly threats lurking in the shadows. At the end of the day, the templar isn’t there to tell you how you should live your life; they’re there to make sure you can live your life, to protect you from the monsters that could appear at any moment.</p><h1>Foundations of the Faith</h1><p>The Silver Flame was forged in the Age of Demons, and heroes of many cultures have wielded its power over the ages. The following principles form the common foundation of the Flame, regardless of whether you’re a Ghaash’kala orc or a templar of Thrane - though extremist sects pick and choose which tenets to follow or discard. When dealing with followers of the Silver Flame, keep these in mind.</p><h2>A Power, Not A God</h2><p>The Silver Flame is a force created during the Age of Demons to bind the overlords. It has a concrete purpose: it is the cage that keeps apocalyptic evil at bay. The Sovereigns and Six are deities, believed to influence every facet of daily life. The Silver Flame is different. It’s not seen as an anthropomorphic entity; rather, followers recognize it as a pure force of celestial energy. It doesn’t influence the world on its own, and can only empower champions who will use that gift to protect the innocent. The Flame itself doesn’t speak to people; instead, it is the Voice of the Flame that guides the faithful. Ultimately, the Silver Flame is a resource; if you seek to protect the innocent from supernatural evil, you may be able to draw on the power of the Flame to aid you in your fight.</p><h2>Coexistence</h2><p>The Silver Flame won’t grant you a good harvest as Arawai will, nor will it send storms like the Devourer. The Silver Flame isn’t a god, but a resource to serve a specific purpose, and there is no inherent conflict between the beliefs of the Silver Flame and the Sovereign Host. The Church of the Silver Flame is a practical, pragmatic faith founded on active public service. It takes the approach that the world will manage itself - that there will be a harvest or a storm whether or not you acknowledge Arawai or the Devourer - and that the most important thing is to protect people from the darkness that could destroy them. The church doesn’t inherently challenge the worship of the Sovereigns, and the two faiths have coexisted peacefully throughout history. Paladins of Dol Arrah often coordinate with templars of the Silver Flame to deal with threats, and Vassals of the Sovereign Host are usually happy to accept the assistance of templars when danger strikes.</p><h2>Defense of All</h2><p>The Silver Flame protects the entire world from the evil of the overlords, and likewise, those who channel its power should protect all innocents from supernatural threats. While extremist sects may stray from this path, the core beliefs of the Church of the Silver Flame don’t elevate any nation or species above another. Templars of the Silver Flame should protect everyone from evil. Friars should guide and care for all who are in need.</p><p>This principle was clearly evident during the Last War. Even when the Church took power in Thrane, most priests and templars in other nations continued to serve their people. Regardless of the position of the cardinals and the Keeper, the mission of the Flame is to defend the innocent, not to rule the world. Brelish and Cyran templars would quickly unite with Thranes if a supernatural threat arose in the midst of a conflict; if demons from Shavarath appeared on a battlefield, all templars would unite against them. But in the absence of supernatural evil, there’s nothing preventing a templar from serving their nation or protecting their family. While the templars of Thrane are also the army of Thrane, they still recognize the difference between their sacred duty and their service to their nation.</p><h2>Eternal Evil</h2><p>The Silver Flame was kindled to bind the fiendish overlords, immortal spirits that cannot be destroyed. The overlords are the embodiments of hatred, fear, greed, cruelty - and, like the overlords themselves, these things can never be permanently destroyed, only held at bay. The message of the Silver Flame isn’t that evil can ever be permanently eradicated. It is that we must be ever vigilant and prepared to deal with evil when it arises. Even in the most peaceful moments, a new terror could emerge from Khyber, or a gate could spill shadows out of Mabar. And even in a town of virtuous people, someone could be corrupted by greed or anger. The templar stands ever ready to fight the physical threat, while the minister seeks to keep their people on the virtuous path.</p><h2>Afterlife and the Voices of the Flame</h2><p>The basic doctrine of the Silver Flame doesn’t promise punishment or paradise after death. But its faithful commonly believe that the souls of those who live virtuous lives pass through Dolurrh unharmed, merging with the Silver Flame itself. By strengthening the Flame, these souls continue to protect the innocent of generations to come. Merging with the Flame is generally depicted as a transcendent union with those who have gone before, a state beyond mortal understanding - seen both as a reward and a duty.</p><p>Typically, souls that merge with the Flame don’t return to the mortal world. However, it is possible for a spirit within the Flame to maintain its identity, guiding or advising the faithful from beyond. The Church of the Silver Flame calls out Tira Miron as the Voice of the Flame, who stands between eternity and mortality and guides the faithful toward the light. However, the Ghaash’kala and the serpent cults existed long before the sacrifice of Tira Miron, and they have their own Voices of the Flame - heroes who guide the faithful of these cultures.</p><hr /><blockquote><p>CELESTIALS AND THE SILVER FLAME</p><p>The Silver Flame is tied to Eberron. If you worship the Flame and cast a spell that normally contacts or summons an extraplanar ally, you touch the power of the Flame itself. This could be a couatl, or you could speak to the Voice of the Silver Flame - the spirit of Tira Miron, though now that she is bound to the Silver Flame, she is far more than just a ghost. Conjure celestial will usually summon a couatl, its essence drawn from the Silver Flame and given temporary existence until its task is done. Planar ally can produce more powerful celestials, but these aren’t called from another plane; while they may use the statistics of angels, they are formed from the pure light of the Flame itself and return to the Flame when their work is done</p></blockquote><hr /><h1>The Hierarchy of Evil</h1><p>The Silver Flame empowers mortals to fight against evil. But not all evils are equal, and different threats call for different approaches. The Church of the Silver Flame defines the hierarchy of evil as follows:</p><ul><li>Entities of alien evil - These are the children of Khyber, encompassing all manner of fiends and aberrations. These beings are fundamentally unnatural and innately malevolent; even their presence is seen as harmful to the world.</li><li>Entities of unnatural evil - These are beings once native to Eberron that have been corrupted by alien forces. Undead and lycanthropes are the most obvious examples of this category - innocent people transformed into monsters. Like the followers of the Undying Court, the Church of the Silver Flame maintains that undead are inherently unnatural and harm the living simply through their existence.</li><li>Entities of innate evil - This is the most contentious category on the list, and it is the idea of monsters - that there are creatures native to Eberron who are evil by nature. In the past, the church has placed medusas, harpies, trolls, and similar creatures into this category, asserting that through no fault of their own, these creatures are vessels for supernatural evil and pose a threat to the innocent.</li><li>Those who choose evil - This encompasses all humanoids who are born innocent but choose to follow an evil path. Because such beings aren’t evil by nature, the goal of the faithful should always be to lead them back to the light.</li><li>The evil within - Every follower of the Flame must recognize their own capacity for evil action; only through awareness can they guard against it. The Shadow in the Flame is always whispering, and it is arrogant and foolish to ignore that threat.</li></ul><p>Entities of alien and unnatural evil must be fought with steel and spell. This is the purpose of the Silver Flame: to protect the innocent against these threats. When such forces arise, followers of the Silver Flame are expected to set aside any differences until the evil is defeated; this was seen in the Last War, where templars might serve different nations but would unite to deal with a supernatural threat. If it’s possible to eradicate a threat without violence - such as curing a lycanthrope rather than killing it - that’s acceptable, even laudable. But protection of the innocent should always be the primary concern, which is why the Silver Crusade focused on the eradication of the lycanthropes; the templars rarely had the resources to capture and cure lycanthropes.</p><p>With those who choose evil and those who fall prey to the evil within, the Church of the Silver Flame urges compassion over brutality. Templars take arms against unnatural evil, but it is the purpose of friars and ministers to guide mortals to the light. Innocents must always be protected from those who would harm them, but anyone who chooses evil could be convinced to choose good, and true followers of the Flame are encouraged to act with empathy and compassion for all natural creatures.</p><p>In the past, the church assumed that trolls, harpies, worgs, and similar creatures were innately evil, so templars eliminated these threats wherever they were encountered. With the rise of Droaam and House Tharashk’s introduction of monstrous mercenaries, Khorvaire is learning that these creatures aren’t any more inherently evil than humans or dwarves. Ultimately, it is up to the Keeper of the Flame to make rulings on these matters - much like a past Keeper’s ruling that the deathless of Aerenal are not creatures of unnatural evil. In 992 YK, Keeper Lavira Tagor ruled that the church needed to reevaluate the classification of innate evil, and that templars should judge the actions of creatures in question and seek guidance from the Voice of the Flame. Since then, the Council of Cardinals has been debating the status of Droaam, but Keeper Daran has yet to make a final ruling on the matter.</p><p>The Ghaash’kala, serpent cults, and other paths have their own traditions, each with the same core principle - the Silver Flame is a tool that allows the virtuous to fight fiends and unnatural horrors. Though those paths may share similar beliefs, this particular hierarchy of evil is specifically defined by the Keeper and the doctrine of the Church of Thrane.</p><hr /><blockquote><p>MIRON’S TEARS</p><p>Most believe Miron’s Tears to be an urban legend - a secret order of spies and assassins deep within the Church of the Silver Flame, hidden even from the Keeper and the Cardinals. According to the stories, Tira Miron foresaw the danger of the Shadow in the Flame. On the eve of her battle with Bel Shalor, Tira charged her trusted companion Samyr Kes to monitor the Church that was to come for signs of fiendish corruption - to save those who could be saved, and eliminate those who could not. Those who believe these tales say that it was agents of Miron’s Tears who recognized the threat of Melysse Miron and exposed her as an agent of Bel Shalor.</p></blockquote><hr /><h1>Heresy</h1><p>The Church of the Silver Flame represents just one path of the faith. It was built on the teachings of Tira Miron, but less than a year elapsed between her vision - leading her to embrace the Flame and rally an army - and her final sacrifice to defeat Bel Shalor. Thus, it was’t her own words that established most of the church’s traditions and doctrines, but the words of those who fought alongside her during that year. These were refined over time by priests who’d never met her - despite the passage of time, it’s believed these priests were guided by the Voice in the Flame.</p><p>The Keeper of the Flame is tied specifically to the official Church of the Silver Flame. The Keeper’s power is based in Flamekeep, and the fountain of fire they keep marks the spot where Tira Miron gave her life to restore the bonds of the overlord Bel Shalor. Some people mistakenly assume that this fountain of fire is the Silver Flame. While it’s a focal point where the Silver Flame’s power bleeds into the world and a conduit for those who seek the guidance of the Voice of the Flame, the Silver Flame itself is far more than a spark in one cathedral - its power stretches across Eberron, binding overlords on every continent. The Church of the Silver Flame celebrates the Keeper of the Flame as being both the vessel of the Voice and the channel for the power of the Flame. However, the faithful of other cultures - such as the Ghaash’kala of the Demon Wastes - see the Keeper as a powerful priest and nothing more.</p><p>The Church of the Silver Flame is largely willing to overlook the divergent beliefs of groups like the Ghaash’kala. In the church’s eyes, these northern orcs are a curiosity and their unusual beliefs don’t threaten the faithful of the Five Nations. Likewise, the Council of Cardinals has taken no action to suppress the extreme beliefs of the Pure Flame, even going so far as appointing the puritan Archbishop Dariznu as governor of Thaliost. In part, this is because the Pure Flame came into its own over the course of the Last War, and the cardinals of Thrane had little ability to enforce their will over the faithful of Aundair. Dariznu’s appointment was an effort to ensure that the followers of the Pure Flame would accept the authority of Flamekeep. Despite the church thus far taking no action against the Pure Flame, Keeper Daran is deeply troubled by this sect and is considering the best way to address the problem.</p><p>There have been times when heretical beliefs divided the church, the most infamous known as the Time of Two Keepers. In 497 YK, a peasant woman calling herself Melysse Miron challenged Keeper Kyra Danth for control of Flamekeep and the Church of the Silver Flame. Melysse claimed that Tira Miron had revealed she was Tira’s direct descendant and the rightful Keeper. She challenged many church doctrines and claimed it had strayed from its path. And like Keeper Danth, Melysse was shockingly able to wield the power of the fountain of fire in Flamekeep, performing miracles no lesser priest could match. This triggered a deep schism that lasted for years, until Melysse was finally revealed to be the chosen hand of the Shadow in the Flame - it was not the Silver Flame, but rather the overlord Bel Shalor, that strengthened her in Flamekeep. Because of the fear that her death would allow Bel Shalor to choose a new AntiKeeper, Melysse wasn’t killed; instead, she was petrified and placed in Dreadhold, where she remains to this day.</p><p>More recently, the church was divided in 914 YK when Keeper Serrain was invested with temporal authority over the nation of Thrane. While many celebrated the idea of a kingdom founded on the noble principles of the church, there are many - even some in Thrane itself - who believe that investing cardinals and Keeper with political power distracts the church from its proper mission and serves as an invitation to corruption.</p><p>This served as justification for the foreign templars who fought against Thrane in the Last War; they argued that they continued to respect the spiritual authority of the Keeper, but that the church shouldn’t rule a reunited Galifar. The priests of Stormreach went so far as to condemn the theocracy and Keeper Serrain. In the wake of this division, Stormreach was formally severed from Flamekeep; it receives no support and Flamekeep doesn’t acknowledge its priests within the church hierarchy. As such, Stormreach has become a haven for those who believe in the principles of the Flame but question its doctrine.</p><h1>Corruption</h1><p>The Church of the Silver Flame has lofty aspirations, and it’s easy to find fault when it fails to live up to them. While there’s always potential for corruption in the church, it’s often exaggerated. Stories about corrupt priests can be more dramatic than virtuous ministers who are only there to help, but the majority of priests do strive to live its principles - resisting the evil within, treating others with compassion and empathy, and working together for the common good. The point isn’t that the church is a fundamentally corrupt institution, but rather that no one is perfect - in their imperfections, people can be led astray by the Shadow in the Flame or simply succumb to pride or greed.</p><p>In dealing with corrupt followers of the faith, consider what kind of “corruption” it is and where it comes from. There’s a considerable difference between the Brelish priest who demands gold for a blessing and the Thrane inquisitor who lets their zeal for fighting evil drive them to cruelty.</p><p>Zealots represent the most common form of corruption, especially among paladins or clerics. A zealot is devoted to the principles of the faith, but loses sight of the importance of compassion - giving in to the evil within in their quest to fight evil in the world. This includes those who engage in unnecessary cruelty, especially when dealing with those who choose evil. Zealots have no interest in gold or power, and risk their lives to defend others; they are simply able to justify ruthless and evil actions in the name of the greater good.</p><p>Opportunists seek to use their religious authority for personal gain. This typically involves charging people for services that should be granted freely, or gaining gold or influence by using church resources for unrelated purposes. In Sharn, Archierophant Ythana Morr is often accused of using templars as mercenaries and serving as a strongarm for local merchants. Usually this reflects a fundamental lack of faith, and as a result, opportunists rarely wield divine magic. If an opportunist can channel the power of the Flame, it suggests that somehow, they are able to justify these conflicting concepts - that they truly believe their actions are righteous and serve the greater good, even if those actions incidentally line the pockets of the priest. Such a character might believe that they need greater wealth or influence to help others, or that they are fighting fire with fire - teaching the wicked the error of their ways through political or economic means. Before the Last War, opportunists were usually found in Breland, but the rise of the theocracy has yielded more opportunists in Thrane as well.</p><p>The Tarnished are the worst form of corruption: priests or templars who knowingly serve the Lords of Dust or the Shadow in the Flame while posing as servants of the light. The Tarnished may mimic a devout priest - as Melysse Miron did in the Time of Two Keepers - but they are drawing this power from the Shadow in the Flame. This still requires deep faith, but the Tarnished are devoted to quite different principles. The most widespread form of this corruption is the cult of the Whispering Flame, described in the section on “The Cults of the Dragon Below.” But the Tarnished can also be loners who embrace the evil within alone. In dealing with a Tarnished villain, consider what has caused them to embrace darkness over light. Have the Lords of Dust promised them something priceless? Do they believe mortals are fundamentally flawed or that the cruelty of Bel Shalor is the rightful state of humanity? Do they somehow see themselves as the heroes of the story?</p><h1>Paths of Faith</h1><p>The Silver Flame is older than humanity itself. The Church of the Silver Flame is the dominant manifestation of this faith on Khorvaire, but you can be a follower of the Silver Flame without having ties to the church. There are three primary branches of the Silver Flame today. Most of the preceding entry regarding the Silver Flame details the beliefs and practices of the common faith found most places in Khorvair, The Church of the Silver Flame. However, there are two other significant groups that worship the Silver Flame as well.</p><h2>The Common Faith</h2><p>Templars, friars, and ministers are all part of the formal hierarchy of the Church of the Silver Flame. But you can be a cleric without being an acolyte. You could be a ranger who trusts in the Flame to sharpen your aim even though you have no formal role within the faith. Most of the commoners of Thrane fall into this category: people devoted to the faith, but not part of its structure. What role does the Silver Flame play in daily life?</p><p>A few basic tenets guide the faithful masses. As a farmer, you may not have the strength to fight alien evils, but you can always guard against the evil within and help those around you to choose light instead of darkness. Church doctrine urges the faithful to act with empathy and compassion, seek to understand the troubles of those around you and to lighten their burdens, resist responding to anger with anger, and turn to violence only as a last resort. Not everyone can live up to these ideals, and the Last War was an inherently violent time. But the faith still urges everyone to resist the evil within, and instead to embrace the virtues of generosity and compassion. As discussed earlier, the church also emphasizes unity against supernatural threats. The world is a dangerous place, and those who have strength should always use it to defend the innocent. Every village in Thrane maintains a militia prepared to defend the community from the unnatural. Archery is a common devotional practice among the faithful; some say the rainbow-feathered arrows represent the couatl defending the innocent, but they also reflect the practicality of remaining as far away from danger as possible.</p><p>The Church of Thrane believes in the value of hierarchy, but the church can’t grant the divine powers of a cleric or paladin - these come through faith and noble intent. As such, you can play a character who draws power from the Flame without having any formal tie to the church itself. The primary question is why - if you are a paladin, why have you made the decision not to become a templar? Do you feel the hierarchy is corrupt? Or do you simply feel you’re called to follow a different path?</p><h3>THE CHURCH HIERARCHY</h3><p>Backgrounds are an easy way to create a character with an established place in the hierarchy of the Church of the Silver Flame. Are you still an active agent of the church, or have you been released from your duties after serving with distinction? Eberron: Rising from the Last War presents the templars as an option for the religious order group patron, exploring the idea that your entire group of adventurers could be fighting evil on behalf of the church. However, you could also serve alone. Friars of the Silver Flame are charged to wander the world and combat evil through acts of compassion and charity; if you’re a friar with the powers of a paladin or a cleric, that would certainly encompass protecting innocents from supernatural evil wherever you encounter it. You could be a retired templar who continues to fight evil as an adventurer, or you could be a templar given a specific mission that coincides with the goals of the adventurers. Or you could be tied to the Argentum, an order which began with the mission of finding and destroying dangerous magic items, but that has since come to serve as the espionage arm of the church.</p><p>In making a character with ties to the hierarchy, consider which branch of the church you call home and how this affects your outlook. If you were trained in Flamekeep, you’re most likely a strong supporter of the cardinals and the theocracy. On the other hand, if you’re from Breland, you might be more pragmatic, if not entirely corrupt. As a cleric who served in Sharn, you could potentially take the criminal background instead of acolyte; you no longer have significant influence in the church, but you still have friends in low places.</p><h2>The Ghaash’kala</h2><blockquote><p>In the dawn of time the world belonged to the fiends. The Binding Flame was born from a desperate act of sacrifice. The Overlords cannot be destroyed, merely held at bay; their power yearns to break free from the Flame that binds them, and their servants prey upon those who have inherited the world. The Flame is fueled by courage, and it is only through the vigilance and sacrifice of champions that the light remains strong enough to hold the darkness at bay.</p></blockquote><p>The prisons of the Overlords are scattered across the world, but their power is strongest in the Demon Wastes. Here lies the ruins of Ashtakala, the greatest city of the Age of Demons. Though the Overlords are bound, their power corrupts nature and weak minds. The Wastes are filled with horrors, both mortal and immortal. Left unchecked, these terrors would spread to the south and bathe Khorvaire in blood. But ancient magic and geography have established a barrier: the mountain range known as the Labyrinth. This barrier can’t stop the powerful rakshasa from leaving the Wastes, but it serves as a funnel for the lesser horrors.</p><p>Bloodthirsty barbarians, minor fiends, twisted creatures… all flow through the Labyrinth seeking release. One force guards the gates of the Labyrinth and protects the innocents to the south: The Ghost Guardians, the Ghaash’kala, sworn to serve the Binding Flame from birth to death and beyond. The life of a Ghost Guardian is one of endless strife. It is a mirror to the Flame itself: it is a battle than can never be truly won, but through sacrifice they can continue to contain the evil and protect the innocent from harm.</p><p>The Ghaash’kala have no written records and don’t know exactly how long their ancestors have fought against the darkness. It’s clear that couatl trained and equipped the first Ghaash’kala long before humanity came to Khorvaire. As such, the Ghaash’kala may be the first humanoids to channel the power of the Silver Flame… or as they call it, Kalok Shash, the Binding Flame.</p><p>For more information on the @Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-lore.zL7IPKb96bwBlfMz]{Ghaash'kala}, please see the journal entry dedicated to them in the \"Watchers on the Wall\" section of Organizations.</p><h2>Serpent Cults</h2><p>Serpent cults are the Silver Flame’s oldest tradition, though they’re virtually unknown in the present day. Rather than venerating the Flame itself, serpent cults honor the countless couatl whose sacrifice brought it into being. A common myth says that the couatl were formed by the last breath of Siberys, unleashed to contain Khyber’s evil. These cults maintain that the Silver Flame was formed when the couatl sacrificed their individual existence and bound their celestial energy together to bind the overlords; research suggests that this is true, though it’s not in the common doctrine of the church. Rather than revering a Voice or Keeper of the Flame, the serpent cults listen for the guidance of couatl themselves. A few couatl did remain separate from the Flame in order to serve as guardians or carry out specific missions, and it’s also possible for couatl to temporarily serve as spiritual guides; this was the case with Tira Miron, and could also be the case with an aasimar tied to the Silver Flame.</p><p>As a member of a serpent cult, the hermit background can be a good option to reflect that you possess secret knowledge about the Silver Flame that the modern church knows nothing about. If you’re tied to a serpent cult, work with your DM to determine its size, origin, and influence. Is your sect a band of six people living in the Blade Desert, or are you tied to the Shulassakar—a race of rainbow-feathered yuan-ti who have been watching from the shadows for millennia? Do you have a specific mission? Or do you have a less-spiritual reason for adventuring, despite your unusual faith?</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"The Blood of Vol","type":"text","_id":"bIXWc9gPZ7GfohCc","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>Life is pain, a ceaseless struggle against hunger, disease, and despair.

Perhaps we all have a spark of divinity within us, a spark that can become a force to rival the Silver Flame. Perhaps one day we can end the cycle of death and misery, so all can live long enough to find their divinity within. Until then, the best we can do is to hold our family and friends close, defy cruel fate, and fight to live as long as we can.</p><p>This is the message of the Blood of Vol. Life is suffering and death is annihilation, but you can defy this cruel fate - and perhaps even break the cycle for good.</p><h1>Foundations of the Faith</h1><p>Most followers of the Blood of Vol identify as Seekers of the Divinity Within - usually shortened to Seekers - though there are other traditions within the faith. The Blood of Vol has long been vilified, with outsiders often viewing it as a death cult, falsely equating it with the cult of Katashka the Gatekeeper, or blaming its members for plagues and blights. In the midst of misinformation and fear, what is the truth of the Blood of Vol?</p><h2>Born in Khorvaire</h2><p>Human settlers to Khorvaire brought the faith of the Sovereign Host with them, but the Blood of Vol is indigenous to the continent. The line of Vol was a noble line of Aerenal with a long tradition of necromancy tracing its roots back to Xen’drik. When members of the line of Vol developed the dragonmark known as the Mark of Death, they undertook a risky series of experiments designed to unlock its full powers. This ended when the Undying Court and the dragons of Argonnessen joined forces to eradicate the bloodlines that carried the Mark of Death. In the aftermath of this brutal purge, those elves who had supported Vol but didn’t bear its blood were given the choice of exile or swearing fealty to the Sibling Kings of Aerenal. This resulted in a wave of exiled elves settling in the Lhazaar Principalities and spreading west into the lands that are now Karrnath.</p><p>These exiles brought the knowledge of necromancy along with stories of how the heroic family of Vol had sought to attain godhood, only to be destroyed by the jealous gods. The people of the region knew nothing of Aereni traditions or dragonmarks, and they blended this story with their own experience of life in a harsh land, local tyrants, and the empty promises of Sovereign priests. And in the process, they somehow discovered something real. The line of Vol had never sought the divinity within, but these first priests found it, drawing divine power from their own conviction and their own souls.</p><p>So despite its name, the religion was never practiced by the line of Vol, nor by the infamous Erandis Vol herself, who was in hiding during the period in which the faith evolved. It is a faith born of the blending of elf and human myths and traditions. While the faithful believe that “Vol” was the first person to find the divinity within and challenge the curse of mortality, the faith is based around the divinity within each of us, not the worship of this mythical Vol. Even devoted priests of Vol do not know Erandis Vol’s identity, though they respect the name of “Vol” as author of their core texts, believing that this Vol challenged the Sovereigns, then was subsequently destroyed by these jealous gods - a martyr of the faith. Modern Seeker scholars debate the origins of the name, whether Vol was an individual or a group of people, or related to the elven line at all. So if Erandis Vol were to proclaim her true identity, many of the faithful would be impressed by her lineage, but her bloodline alone wouldn’t give her divine authority.</p><h2>Always in Opposition</h2><p>Millennia ago, as the faith of the Blood of Vol emerged in pre-Galifar Khorvaire, it stood in opposition to the dominant beliefs and authorities of the time. The tyrannical leaders asserted that the Sovereigns blessed their bloodlines and their rule. By challenging the benevolence of the Sovereigns, these early Seekers were also challenging the despots of the time. As time marched on and those petty tyrants fell, the Sovereign Host remained the dominant faith of humanity in Khorvaire, and the philosophical divide between Seeker and Vassal only grew.</p><p>The Seekers were also shunned for their use of necromancy, generally considered taboo and said to be condemned by Aureon and Dol Arrah. This prejudice grew worse with the rise of Galifar and the Church of the Silver Flame, which asserted that undead are inherently anathema and drain the life from the world by their very existence. In turn, this caused people to blame plagues and blights on the Seekers. However, the Blood of Vol is a faith grounded in the principle of an oppressive universe, and it endured in spite of this prejudice and persecution. But it never spread far beyond the harsh lands where it began, and Seekers are often still met with fear and suspicion today.</p><h2>Stronger Together</h2><p>“The universe is against us, and all we have is each other.” This is one of the most basic principles of the Blood of Vol. Despite its grim outlook, it is a faith that emphasizes the value of friendship, family, and community. There are no benevolent gods looking out for us, so we have to look out for each other. Death is the end, so we can’t let it steal the people we care about without a fight. And since there is no pleasant afterlife waiting for us, we should treasure the time we have with those we love. These values have kept the Blood of Vol alive through the centuries: the deep commitment to community and to working together even in the face of impossible odds.</p><h2>The Divinity Within</h2><p>“Divinity lies within our blood.”</p><p>In the eyes of the Seeker, life and the soul are both divine forces. Every soul has the potential to evolve and develop divine power - but this takes time and willpower, and most mortals die before they accomplish it.</p><p>As a divine spellcaster who follows the Blood of Vol, you believe that your power comes from your own soul. As a paladin, you are calling on the power of your own blood when you heal your allies or smite your enemies. The visible manifestations of magic of the Blood of Vol typically involve crimson energy, as if luminous tendrils of blood are flowing from you. But it’s not simply your power. Consider the Seeker priest who casts commune; how can they gain information they don’t already know? The answer is that the divinity within is something far greater than you. It is a god, possessing celestial power you can’t understand or imagine - but it is still in its chrysalis, waiting to be born. When you cast your spell, you awaken a sliver of its power; once the spell is done, it returns to its rest.</p><p>Or at least, that’s what a Seeker believes. Scholars of other faiths argue that the Seekers are deluded, that their powers are simply drawn from some other source, the same kind of delusion that allows a warforged cleric to draw magic from their devotion to the Lord of Blades. However, Seeker priests can reverse this same argument. What proof is there that all clerics aren’t simply drawing on their own divine sparks - that even a paladin of Dol Arrah mistakenly thinks their power come from above, when really, it’s always come from within?</p><h2>Necromancy and the Undead</h2><p>The Blood of Vol emerged from collaboration with Aereni necromancers, and the undead have always been associated with the faith. First and foremost, this link is born out of practicality. Seekers have no reverence for corpses; the divinity within is tied to life and to the soul, and once those things are gone, what’s left is just meat and bone. As an extension of this, most Seekers want their corpses to be put to use. The faith is driven by the idea of serving a community - why let your corpse go to waste when it can help your friends and family? As such, mindless undead are commonly seen in Seeker communities serving as guardians, performing manual labor, and completing other simple tasks.</p><p>However, a common misconception is that Seekers want to become undead. Some do, driven purely by the fear of oblivion, but undeath is a miserable half-life, not a triumph. The divinity within is bound to your blood and your soul, so Seekers believe that the souls of undead are trapped in their corpses, the spark of divinity lost to them. Those who embrace undeath are seen as martyrs, and generally expected to protect and serve their Seeker community. One of the most public of these champions is the mummy lord Malevanor, the high priest of Atur. The former high priest of Atur was the mummy Askalor, who held the post for over four hundred years - but he was weary of his long undead existence. When Malevanor was grievously injured during the Last War, Askalor transferred his power and his undead existence to his apprentice. This raises an interesting question: if the divinity within lies in the blood, how does Malevanor cast divine magic? The answer is that Seeker communities ritually draw their blood and share it with these champions. Vampires drink this blood, while mummies or liches may bathe in it. Through this, undead priests draw their power from the blood of the living faithful.</p><p>Another factor in the long association between the Blood of Vol and necromancy is that Seeker communities have often formed in or near manifest zones to Mabar. While such areas are often inhospitable or dangerous, over the course of many centuries, Seekers have learned how to tap the energies of these places. Because Mabaran manifest zones are usually blighted, outsiders often accuse the Seekers of causing blights. In reality, the Seekers often perform rituals that limit the negative effects of the manifest zones - so instead of causing the plagues and blights associated with Mabar, they often prevent them.</p><h2>War and Peace</h2><p>Throughout its history, the Blood of Vol has been treated with fear and suspicion by the people of the Five Nations. It’s a faith that has dwelled in the shadows. This changed early in the Last War. His nation crippled by famine, King Kaius I accepted the aid of the Blood of Vol. The Seekers provided undead soldiers and necromantic expertise; with the resources of the crown behind them, Seekers developed necromantic rituals and weapons never before imagined. In exchange, Kaius elevated the Blood of Vol to the official state religion. Warlords were encouraged to embrace the faith, and Seeker families were given lands and titles.</p><p>For a time, the Blood of Vol spread and was celebrated - or so it seemed. Most of the old warlord families still despised the Seekers and felt that the use of undead in battle debased the proud martial traditions of their ancestors. Toward the end of the war, Regent Moranna turned on the faith and the Blood of Vol became a scapegoat for all of Karrnath’s troubles. Moranna claimed that the famines and plagues the people had suffered were caused by the Seekers. Its nobles were stripped of their lands. Chivalric orders of Seekers were disbanded. Some - notably the infamous Order of the Emerald Claw - refused to surrender, but most Seekers remained loyal to their nation even when it betrayed them.</p><p>Today, the Blood of Vol has returned to the shadows, though there are still Seekers who serve the crown. Kaius III has sealed most of his undead forces in the crypts below Korth and Atur, but he isn’t willing to entirely surrender this strategic advantage. Fort Bones and Fort Zombie remain bastions of loyal Seekers. But the faith is no longer celebrated, and the old warlord lines still mutter that they would have won the war if only they’d relied on skill and steel instead of foul magics. In playing a Karrnathi Seeker, do you support the crown and believe that Kaius III is only doing what he has to do to maintain the support of the warlords, or do you despise Kaius III and Moranna for betraying your faith?</p><hr /><p></p><blockquote><p>CELESTIALS, FIENDS, AND THE BLOOD OF VOL</p><p>If the power of the Blood of Vol flows from within, who answers when a cleric conjures a celestial or invokes planar ally? One simple answer is for the DM to use a being who has the statistics of a celestial or fiend, but that is formed from blood and magic; it’s a manifestation of your own divine essence and fades away when its work is done. This might seem a strange match for planar ally, a spell that normally requires payment to an external force, but even an ally of your own essence might demand a service in return. This could be seen as a request from your subconscious - a demand that you do something you know you should do, but that you’ve been trying to ignore. On the other hand, it could be a mysterious task with no discernible purpose; this ties to the fact that your Divinity Within is something beyond mere mortal understanding, and you don’t fully understand what it needs or wants.</p><p>Another possibility is that you’re drawing on the Seeker community rather than reaching to the planes for assistance. One principle of the faith is that champions become undead so that they can help other Seekers. When you cast planar ally, rather than calling a celestial or fiend, you might summon an undead champion of your faith; this could be anything from a vampire to a mummy lord or a death knight. In this case, the payment they demand for their service would likely be a tithe to the Seeker temple they are bound to. On a smaller scale, your DM could similarly decide that when you cast conjure celestial, it summons a sarcastic flameskull instead of an angel.</p></blockquote><hr /><h1>Paths of the Faith</h1><p>When creating a player character or NPC associated with the Blood of Vol, consider the following paths and which best fits your character.</p><h2>The Seekers of the Divinity Within</h2><p>The Seekers of the Divinity Within are the largest and most widespread tradition associated with the Blood of Vol. The faith isn’t as formally structured as the Church of the Silver Flame or even the Sovereign Host. For the most part, Seekers keep to themselves, living in their own villages and small towns or in isolated neighborhoods of larger communities, where they can practice their traditions without drawing the ire of their neighbors. The exception is the city of Atur: known as the City of Night, this remains the most public bastion of the Blood of Vol. Expanded and fortified during the Last War, Atur is the seat of Karrnath’s necromantic research and development. While Kaius III has stripped the Blood of Vol of much of its standing, he still recognizes its potential value should the war begin anew, and many believe that he continues to provide support to Atur. The mummy lord Hass Malevanor is the high priest of Atur and the current spiritual leader of the faith. However, there are stories of undead champions who have guided and protected the Seekers for centuries. Sometimes known as the Crimson Covenant, these enigmatic figures may be the true power behind Atur.</p><p>Outside Atur, for the most part, each Seeker community relies on their abactor - the priest that oversees a temple or community - and they rarely reach out to the world beyond. The largest temple in a region serves as a hub, coordinating with the other Seeker communities around it. But every community has its own stories and traditions and they’re generally unconcerned with “heresy”; feel free to develop your character’s own unique beliefs.</p><p>As an acolyte of the Blood of Vol, you’ve been ordained as a priest, but not bound to a single community as an abactor. You can receive shelter in any Seeker community. Are you following orders from Malevanor or the Crimson Covenant itself? Are you guided by visions from your own divinity within? As a Seeker hermit, you spent your time in isolation communing with your divinity within, and your Discovery may relate to the faith. Perhaps you have an insight into how to unlock your own power. Or perhaps you’ve learned a secret about the Crimson Covenant, and believe that a malevolent force is manipulating the faithful Seekers - can you find a way to bring down this ancient evil and free your people?</p><h2>The Bloodsails</h2><p>The elves of the Bloodsail Principality occupy the island of Farlnen in the Lhazaar Principalities. The Bloodsails share the same roots as the Blood of Vol, as the principality was founded by Aereni exiles. However, they have followed a different path and hewn closer to the traditions of their ancestors. They don’t believe in the divinity within and readily seek immortality through undeath. However, the island can only support a limited number of vampires, and Bloodsails must earn their afterlife by paying velgys - blood money - to the lords of the land. Those who fail to earn enough to buy a better afterlife are instead bound to objects after death. Bloodsail elves are often tied to ships and sails, enabling their vessels to move across a windless sea, sails driven by ghosts.</p><p>Bloodsail elves often bear crimson tattoos that are tied to their families and vessels. The Bloodsails are exceptional sailors, so both sailor and pirate are logical backgrounds for a player character. As an adventurer, you might have been exiled from your island, or you could be searching for a way to quickly earn the blood money you need to leave mortality behind.</p><h2>The Order of the Emerald Claw</h2><p>The Order of the Emerald Claw began as an elite military force comprised of devoted Seekers. When Regent Moranna turned on the Blood of Vol, the Emerald Claw refused to stand down. Today, members of the order include both Seeker extremists and Karrnathi patriots furious at Kaius III for embracing peace. The ultimate leader of the Emerald Claw is the lich known to most as the Queen of the Dead, though those in the inner circle know her to be the infamous Lady Illmarrow of Farlnen. She claims that her violent actions are for the good of Karrnath and the Blood of Vol, but in truth, they primarily benefit her and serve to spread terror.</p><p>The Order of the Emerald Claw is full of villains whose actions have cast all Seekers in a bad light, and most Seekers despise the Emerald Claw. If you have ties to the Emerald Claw, you could have served with them before realizing that the Queen of the Dead is pursuing her own evil agenda; if so, you could be determined to find some way to destroy the lich and restore honor to the order. Or you could be convinced that Lady Illmarrow truly does have the best interests of your people at heart. Has she been unjustly vilified? Or are you simply a tool?</p><p>If you wish to play a Seeker veteran without the villainous ties of the Emerald Claw, the Order of the Onyx Skull was another elite unit comprised of Seekers, but disbanded on Moranna’s orders. As a paladin of the Blood of Vol, you could be a knight of the Onyx Skull who has taken up adventuring after being cast aside by your nation. Are you still loyal to Karrnath? Or do you believe Kaius III is a traitor to your people?</p><h2>Thieves of Life</h2><p>The Seekers of the Divinity Within value community, urging the faithful to stand together. But there are others who follow the principles of the Blood of Vol who prefer to stand alone. The hermits known as Thieves of Life are determined to unlock their divinity within at any cost - not to help others, but solely to further their own quest for power and immortality. Thieves of Life are often master necromancers, but never become undead themselves; instead, they specialize in magics that allow them to drain the life from their foes.</p><p>As a hermit devoted to the Blood of Vol, you could choose the path of the Thief of Life. You are utterly devoted to the pursuit of your personal divinity, and your Discovery has likely shown you the path you must take. You might be a cleric, a sorcerer, or a witch (with your patron being your own nascent divinity within). What binds you to your fellow adventurers, and why would they choose to associate with you? You may be utterly devoted to your quest for immortality - but what is your redeeming feature, your anchor to humanity?</p><p>An unusual option for a Thief of Life hermit is to say that you’ve actually been in a state of suspended animation for decades or even centuries - your Discovery was made on an inner journey. You were once far more powerful than you are today, but your powers have yet to return; as you gain levels, you are actually regaining the power you once had. If this is the case, it could be that one or more of your adventuring companions are actually descendants of yours; while you’re obsessed with your quest for immortality, you also care about your own bloodline.</p><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"The Druidic Sects","type":"text","_id":"qHmMbPDXJeucS1sQ","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>The druids of Eberron draw on the primal magic that sleeps within the earth. Druidism was originally taught to the lesser races by the dragon Vvaraak, who foresaw the daelkyr incursion and taught the orcs of Khorvaire how to tap into Eberron's power and seal the daelkyr deep within Khyber. Over the following millennia, Vvaraak's teachings spread across the continent, becoming the foundation for a variety of druidic sects. Eberron holds many more than those named in this section, these are merely the traditions detailed in sources.</p></blockquote><h3>Ashbound</h3><p>This small sect believes that arcane magic corrupts, pointing to calamities such as the Mourning as evidence for how arcane magic will doom the world. The more moderate of the Ashbound simply protest and choose to live far away from civilization, while extremists sabotage the lightning rail and stage raids on areas with heavy use of arcane magic. This sect harrows the Eastern Eldeen Reaches, with groves and meeting places that are secluded and far from civilization.</p><h3>Children of Winter</h3><p>The Children of Winter believe that modern conveniences have disrupted the natural cycle of life and death, and fear that Eberron, source of mortal life, has a grand plan as yet unfulfilled; if mortals stray too far from the path Eberron intended, she will wipe the slate clean and start the world anew. Due to their fervent belief in a coming apocalypse, members of this extremist sect dedicate themselves to encouraging natural selection, intentionally spreading plague and disease as an important part of the natural order, and opposing the growth of civilization. The Children of Winter are concentrated in the southern Reaches, near the Gloaming within the Towering Wood.</p><h3>Followers of the Broken Path</h3><p>Within the Mournland, a small band of warforged follow an unusual path. These living constructs may be encased in metal, but beneath lies living wood, and they feel a deep kinship between themselves and nature. This new and curious sect of druids call themselves the Followers of the Broken Path. In seeking to understand the world and their place in it, these warforged have developed a desire to heal the scars left by the Last War, particularly the open wound of the Mournland.</p><h3>Gatekeepers</h3><p>This sect of druids, largely forgotten today, created the seals that bind the daelkyr to Khyber. The fading Gatekeeper tradition is most common among the orcs of the Shadow Marches and Eldeen Reaches, but also has adherents among the lizardfolk of Q’barra and Xen’drik, as well as the humans of Seren.</p><h3>Greensingers</h3><p>Well known for their positive relationship with fey creatures, the Greensingers believe in embracing the planes as extensions of the natural world. They are often found near the Twilight Demesne in the Eldeen Reaches, where the lines of Eberron and Thelanis are blurred.</p><h3>Iredar</h3><p>An ancient and unique tradition, the iredar kobolds of the mountains worship Eberron directly, claiming that their magic is their right as the first-born mortal children of the Progenitors.</p><h3>Landforged Walkers</h3><p>As the Last War drew to a close and the warforged were freed, a few of them wandered into the wilds of the world. From Xen'drik to the forests of the Eldeen Reaches, these warforged have formed a physical bond with the earth, growing plants upon their bodies as they try to become living extensions of the land itself. They claim that plants are as alive as they are, complete with souls, and treat them with great reverence.</p><h3>Maskweavers</h3><p>The Mask Weavers of the Talenta Plains serve as intermediaries between the spirit worlds of the planes and the halfling clans. Guides and shamans, the most sacred duty of the Mask Weavers is helping their people construct their spirit masks. The Talenta halflings believe these masks bond their spirits to those of their mounts while hunting.</p><h3>Moonspeakers</h3><p>A tradition amongst shifter tribes across Khorvaire, Moonspeakers search for signs and portents in the movements of Eberron's twelve moons. They believe the moons in the sky hold sway over their animalistic natures.</p><h3>Shadows of the Forest</h3><p>Though most druidic sects practice far from civilization, the Shadows of the Wood violate the laws of Breland by calling the King's Forest of Breland their home. This small sect numbers in the mere hundreds, split into five bands who remain in constant motion. They claim to follow a whispering voice on the wind, at times clashing with forces of the kingdom, and other times helping them. Whether protecting travelers from ravenous beasts or clashing with the King's Rangers, the Shadows are as elusive and fickle as the wind.</p><h3>Siyal Marrain</h3><p>These druids of the Tairnadal have the honor of raising and caring for Valenar beasts, from their famous horses to their equally elegant hawks, hounds, and other animals.</p><h3>Wardens of the Wood</h3><p>A moderate group that seeks balance between nature and civilization, the Wardens of the Woods are the closest thing the Eldeen Reaches has to a central government. The Wardens’s leader, the awakened greatpine Oalian, serves as nominal leader of the region</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"The Many Faiths","type":"text","_id":"Fy5xEGnkfHWXNuJu","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>Faith is as diverse as the faithful. Across the face of Eberron, many cultures have developed their own sets of values and beliefs. As to their validity, when no gods walk upon the world, who is to say? Regardless of what you worship, with enough faith, it’s theoretically possible you might channel divine power from that faith. A charismatic cult leader may believe in themselves so much that they draw power from that belief and that of their followers, performing miracles that a simple con artist could never achieve. However, scholars debate where this sort of divine power comes from - some assert that it’s a communal pool of faith empowering the faithful, others that it’s channeling power from true deities, and still others argue all power comes from the one's own spirit. Here are a few of the various lesser faiths that are present throughout the world of Eberron.</p></blockquote><h3>The Undying Court</h3><p>The Aereni tradition of ancestor worship has evolved considerably since the birth of the Undying Court. Instead of revering those ancestors long dead, the Aereni venerate the dead that remain. In the eyes of the elves, existence is a spiritual journey that takes thousands of years to accomplish—a journey only the undying can complete. Thus, the Aereni honor the deathless who are on this final path, but their true deity is the combined essence of the ascended councilors, the undying who have journeyed beyond life and death to reach the final destination of the elven soul. While the ascendant councilors can still take physical form, the elves do not worship them as individual deities. Instead, they revere the ascendant union as the ultimate embodiment of the elf race.</p><p>As a result of these beliefs, the Aereni do not fear death. On the contrary, it is a state to be desired as the next step on the path to ascension. However, an elf must earn the right to walk this path. The Priests of Transition are the ambassadors to the Undying Court, and it is these clerics who judge the achievements of an elven life and decide the fate of a candidate. Those who have shown tremendous heroism and skill at arms may be reborn as undying soldiers, while the wisest among the elves become undying councilors. An elf judged to be flawed or foolish may be left to die, leaving room for a stronger spirit to enter the community. But more often than not, the Priests of Transition use raise dead to restore a fallen elf so that he may continue his journey along the path of existence.</p><h3>The Keepers of the Past</h3><p>The Tairnadal elves of Valenar and Northern Aerenal have a different worship of their ancient dead than the rest of the Aereni. While they respect the elders of the Undying Court, they worship the spirits of the warriors of Xen’drik—elves who fell long before the Undying Court was raised. The Tairnadal priests are known as the Keepers of the Past, and their ranks include both clerics and bards. At birth (or upon joining the Tairnadal, in the case of a half-elf or Aereni recruit) the Keepers of the Past consult the spirits to determine an elf’s patron ancestor. The Tairnadal believe that by emulating the behavior of their patron ancestors, they give those ancestors a chance to live again in the current generation.</p><h3>The Path of Light</h3><p>The kalashtar follow the Path of Light, believing that the Dreaming Dark - the otherworldly quori spirits guiding the Inspired - are not as benevolent as they claim. This philosophical faith urges its followers to fight the Dreaming Dark through a lifetime of meditation and spirituality, weakening the evil quori and gradually turning the plane from one of darkness to light. A smaller sect of this philosophy is no longer content to patiently meditate, and has begun to take action against the forces of the Dreaming Dark. These warriors - primarily Khorvairian kalashtar - refer to themselves as shadow watchers.</p><h3>The Draconic Prophecy</h3><p>Priests of the Draconic Prophecy embrace the idea that there is a guiding force underlying reality, and that they can see glimpses of its divine plan. A priest of the Draconic Prophecy believes that their divine powers are granted to keep the Prophecy on its proper path—that when a cleric uses cure wounds to save a comrade, it’s because that person isn’t destined to die today. When they cast a spell such as commune, it doesn’t contact an extraplanar entity, but reveals a cryptic glimpse into the Prophecy itself. </p><p>Despite having priests, this isn’t an organized religion and there are no clearly established traditions. It’s a calling, and each champion must find their own path. Priests of the Prophecy are often set in opposition to forces that seek to manipulate the Prophecy and to use it for their own ends, notably the fiendish Lords of Dust.</p><h3>The Becoming God</h3><p>This small cult believes that the souls of the warforged flow from a greater spiritual power. Those who follow the path of the Becoming God believe that House Cannith was merely a tool of the Becoming God; Cannith created bodies, but it was the God that shared its essence and gave the warforged life. Followers believe that each warforged holds a divine spark, that their people have a destiny, and that when they work as one, they can change the world. Followers seek to ensure a positive future for the warforged race, seeking to reactivate the old creation forges or to find a new way to create warforged. The faithful are also charged with helping to build a physical body for the Becoming God itself, and a community of warforged in the Mournland labors toward this aim. It could be that this vessel will be a vast form that dwarfs even the warforged colossi, but perhaps the Becoming God’s size doesn’t matter, only its perfection. Followers of the faith may receive visions of objects that must be located and brought to the Mournland to help with this quest. The cult of the Becoming God is notably less violent than the followers of the Lord of Blades. The faithful are determined to protect the warforged and help them reach their full potential, but they generally believe that it’s possible to work with creatures of flesh and blood, and harmony is better than strife.</p><h3>The Lord of Blades</h3><p>The Lord of Blades is a charismatic leader who lives in the Mournland, preaching that the warforged represent a new and higher level of existence, destined to replace the weak races of flesh and blood. The Lord of Blades is rumored to possess a creation forge, but many dismiss this as a self-serving rumor started by the Lord of Blades themself.</p><h3>The Reforged</h3><p>The Reforged embrace the living half of their nature as living constructs. They devote themselves to introspection, emotion, and insight, contemplating the place of warforged in the wider world and the meaning of life itself. Some Reforged even go so far as to remove the metal plating of standard warforged models, becoming as much like flesh and blood as possible.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"knTUi1bTspduSmIG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ay85qa7EPrRQ26Pp"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1670017766032,"modifiedTime":1674934747281,"lastModifiedBy":"knTUi1bTspduSmIG"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"6PLXm10mIj8oiCaA"}

kingdom of Galifar. The Last War took a toll on the nation and its citizens, slowly toppling its many achievements as it became the battleground on which the armies of Karrnath and Thrane and Breland clashed. Finally, disaster struck. No one knows if the catastrophe was caused by a weapon from an enemy nation or a doomsday device of Cyre’s own design. The cataclysm may have been deliberate; it may have been an accident. In the end, the result was the same. Beautiful Cyre, jewel of Galifar’s vast holdings, exploded in a blast of arcane power the likes of which hadn’t been seen since the ruin of Xen’drik forty thousand years before. On the Day of Mourning in 994 YK, Cyre disappeared. Now the region that was once Cyre goes by a different, darker name. Now it is simply the Mournland.</span></p><p

the people of Thrane seven hundred years ago, and this religious fervor remains the driving force behind the nation. Thrane was one of the original Five Nations founded by the human settlers of Khorvaire; the culture and heritage of the region goes back millennia. It was absorbed into the Kingdom of Galifar and remained a pillar of that celebrated kingdom for almost a thousand years. While the rest of the Five Nations followed the tenets of the Sovereign Host, a new religion found life in Thrane before spreading far and wide across Khorvaire. In the wake of the Last War, Thrane stands as a theocracy devoted to the Silver Flame. </span></p><p

Shadowcrag Mountains. The eastern Reaches feature fertile plains and rolling hills, but dense forests cover the majority of the nation. These forests house some of the most primaeval trees on the continent, ancient growths that have survived the rise and fall of empires and witnessed the arrival of humans on the shores of Khorvaire. The forces of magic permeate these woods, and strange beasts and mischievous fey roam the land. Many dangers also lurk in the deep woods, and the humanoids who make their homes in these forests don’t always take kindly to visitors.</span></p><p

controls the area east of the Hoarfrost Mountains. This strip of the continent’s eastern shore, along with the chain of islands that wraps around the coast and extends north into the Bitter Sea, makes up the region known as the Lhazaar Principalities. Named for the near-mythic explorer who led the humans to Khorvaire some three thousand years ago, the Lhazaar Principalities have always been grouped together-even though the individual princes rarely see themselves as part of a greater whole.</span></p><p

But while the maps reflected this claim, few Brelish lived in the western barrens beyond the Graywall Mountains. The place has always been dangerous, a haven for monsters of all sorts, and the land was never easy to work or hunt. A few brave settlers tried to tame the land over the years, but none of them ever met with much luck. As the Last War wore on, monster warbands became more aggressive, striking at Breland either at the behest of warring nations or for their own spoils of war. In 987 YK, King Boranel of Breland evacuated the few remaining Brelish and declared that the land west of Graywall was sealed and off limits. In that same year, a trio of hags declared the sovereignty of the new nation of Droaam.</span></p><p

This flat tableau of rugged grassland gives way to the punishing heat and sand of the Blade Desert before rising into the forlorn peaks and crumbling cliffsides of the Endworld Mountains. Across this vast expanse, herds of buffalo-sized dinosaurs run wild, and halflings wander in nomadic tribes. The halflings control a territory bordered by Karrnath, the Mror Holds, Q’barra, Valenar, and the Mournland. Every year, the Blade Desert seems to creep farther into the grasslands, but as long as life can be squeezed from the Plains, the Talenta halfling tribes will survive.</span></p><p

From this island sanctuary, they have seen the Empire of Dhakaan rise and fall, and they expect to be around long after the Five Nations have fallen to dust. Here are a few more important things to know about Aerenal.</p><h3>The Undying Court</h3><p>Aerenal is ruled by the living. The Sibling Kings lead the nation from Shae Cairdal, and the high priests and lords of the lines are mortal elves. But the dead guide and protect the living. When remarkable elves die, they are preserved beyond death. Most are tied to spirit idols, statuettes that preserve the soul and prevent its dissolution in Dolurrh. But others are raised as deathless, undead similar to mummies but sustained by positive energy. Deathless soldiers guard the catacombs and temples, and deathless sages and councilors share their knowledge and wisdom with their descendants. Over time, the deathless can rise to an even greater state, becoming beings of pure spirit with little need for a body. These sprits, known as ascendant councilors, reside in the great city of Shae Mordai, and it is when their spirits join together in a mystical gestalt that they wield divine power.</p><p>Many outsiders assume that the ascendant councilors are the Undying Court, and it’s true they are the source of its power. But the Undying Court refers to all the undead guardians of the island, from the soldiers to the spirit idols. You may not expect to become an ascendant councilor—this is a process of evolution that typically takes thousands of years—but you can aspire to join the Undying Court after death.</p><p>As an Aereni, you have a keen awareness of the duty you owe to the Undying Court. The deathless are sustained by positive energy; this can be drawn from Irian manifest zones—such as the one in Shae Mordai—but it is also generated by love and devotion. Unlike many religions in Eberron, the Undying Court doesn’t rely on faith; there’s no question whether the Court exists. But it does depend on devotion. Your prayers and your faith are the offering you give in exchange for all that the Court has done for you and your people—from protecting your land from invasion, plague, and natural disasters to guiding your leaders and training your young. Your ancestors protect you, but they also need your devotion to survive.</p><h3>A Magical Kingdom</h3><p>Both arcane and divine magic are woven into Aereni civilization more deeply than in the Five Nations. Every citizen of Aerenal knows at least one useful cantrip; the skills of a master magewright in Khorvaire would be considered a mere apprentice’s training in Aerenal. Here, spell effects of up to 5th level can be found woven into the fabric of everyday life. Teleportation circles link Aerenal’s great cities, and sending stations allow instant communication across any distance. Buildings are raised using the principles of stone shape. Diviners communicate with other planes, and healers can break curses and reverse petrification. Spell effects of up to 7th level can be encountered in the hands of master wizards and high priests, and Aereni artificers can craft very rare magic items. As you explore Khorvaire and the lands beyond, bear in mind that in your Aereni eyes, it’s little more than a primitive backwater.</p><h3>Perfection in the Past</h3><p>At a glance, the people of Aerenal are simply better at everything than their counterparts in Khorvaire, due to their exceptional work ethic and long lifespan. An Aereni artisan can spend multiple human lifespans perfecting their craft. Even while trancing, an elf may be contemplating their work. However, Aerenal lags behind Khorvaire in industry and innovation. The Aereni aren’t trying to find better ways to do things; an elf artisan’s goal is to match the skills of past masters rather than find new techniques. Challenging the past would be an insult to those ancient masters—and in Aerenal, they’re still around and still teaching their techniques. An Aereni artificer can produce a very rare magic item no Cannith forge can match, but it’s a handcrafted work of art that takes years to produce, while the Cannith forge is churning out a host of common and uncommon items, and constantly searching for ways to innovate. The Five Nations may not match Aerenal today, but over the last thousand years it has evolved dramatically, while Aerenal stands still. You’ve never been encouraged to innovate; you’ve been taught that the old ways are the best ways. Do you agree with this?</p><h2>Noble Lines</h2><p>Aerenal is effectively a collection of city-states, united in devotion to the Sibling Kings and the Undying Court. Each region of the country (save for the northern territory of the Tairnadal) is governed by a noble line. The original settlers of Aerenal came from different cultures and environments, and the lines represent this; while all are united by the common customs of Aerenal, each line has its own unique fashions and traditions. A line is an alliance of ancient families governed by a noble house that carries the name of the line. Thus, “the line of Mendyrian” refers to multiple families, but someone who uses the surname— such as Belaereth Mendyrian—is a member of the noble line. The noble line represents the best of the region; it’s not a hereditary family, but rather, a meritocracy whose members are chosen from the people of the region. Similarly, the Sibling Kings—the rulers of the united kingdom—are members of the same line and symbolically brother and sister, but they aren’t blood relatives. So in life, elves aspire to be appointed to their noble line; in death, they hope to be raised to the Undying Court.</p><h3>Jhaelian</h3><p>The line of Jhaelian governs the region around Taer Kalindal. Jhaelian has strong spiritual traditions; its members are deeply devoted to the Undying Court and to contemplating divine mysteries. This line produces many monks, clerics, and paladins, as well as many members of the Deathguard— the Aereni institution dedicated to hunting down Mabaran undead. Members of this line have a tradition of using cosmetic transmutation to adopt a desiccated appearance—not unlike that of the deathless themselves—though other Jhaelian Aereni prefer to wear masks.</p><h3>Melideth</h3><p>Governors of the region surrounding Pylas Talaear, the line of Melideth produces the finest sailors of Aerenal and maintains the Aereni navy. Due to its mercantile tradition, Melideth Aereni are more comfortable with foreigners than many of their kin. Facial tattoos are a common practice among the Melideth.</p><h3>Mendyrian</h3><p>The line of Mendyrian governs the region around Shae Cairdal, and for most of Aerenal’s history they have also been the source and seat of the Sibling Kings. The Mendyrian Aereni are devoted to arcane lore, and many of the most gifted wizards and artificers are Mendyrian. The Mendyrian Aereni take particular pride in their appearance, favoring ornate patterns and decoration in clothing, elaborate hairstyles, and masks of metal or leather.</p><h3>Tolaen</h3><p>Centered around Pylas Zirinth, the line of Tolaen drives Aerenal’s lumber industry, both harvesting wood for trade and producing the finest architects and wood-masons on the island. While they are devoted to the Undying Court, the Tolaen Aereni are more invested in perfecting physical crafts than in contemplating metaphysical mysteries. The Tolaen also produce many of Aerenal’s soldiers and usually have good relations with the Tairnadal. Tolaen Aereni prefer simple, functional clothes with little adornment. Tolaen masks are usually made from wood, and may be intricately carved; Tolaen soldiers often wear half-masks covering their lower faces.</p><h3>Valraea</h3><p>All but unknown in the Five Nations, the Valraea are a line of sea elves. Their ancestors were magebred and charged to guard and govern the coastline of Aerenal. While rare, Valraea can be encountered in any of the port cities of Aerenal and are represented in the Undying Court. Valraea typically dress in leather and are comfortable with casual nudity; they fashion masks from shell and bone.</p><p>The line of Vol once governed the region around Shae Deseir, but that line was broken and all ties to the bloodlines bearing the Mark of Death were eliminated thousands of years ago. There are many other noble lines among the Aereni, and you are free to create your own as called for by your story.</p><h2>Mentors</h2><p>As an Aereni elf, you aren’t considered an adult until you’ve passed your first century. During that time, you undergo deep schooling in the traditions of your line and your chosen profession. A century is a long time, and you’ve surely developed important relationships in your youth. Think about who your mentor was - what role did they play in your early life? Are you now working on behalf of your mentor? Are you hoping to solve a mystery for them? To find something they need? To somehow clear their name or vindicate their beliefs? Are you your mentor’s protégé or favored student, or are you driven by the fact that you disappointed them and were banished from their company? Perhaps you have a rival who betrayed your mentor—or stole your place with them!</p><h2>Aereni Quirks</h2><p>In creating an Aereni character, consider the following.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hidden Faces</strong> The Aereni often alter their features following the traditions of their ancestors or their line. Jhaelian Aereni mortify their flesh to appear deathless even while alive. Melideth Aereni favor facial tattoos, often of skulls or other gothic images. All of the lines have distinctive masks, whether of metal, wood, or leather, worn by agents of the line when conducting official business. Likewise, priests of the Undying Court wear the golden mask of the Court when acting in its service. Do you wear a mask, have tattoos, or other cosmetic alterations?</p></li><li><p><strong>Perfect Technique</strong> Aereni are obsessed with tradition—not simply mastering a skill, but performing it in the perfect style of ancient masters. Where Aundair encourages aspiring wizards to develop their own unique style for incantations and gestures, an Aereni wizard spends a decade perfecting their diction then another mastering somatic gestures. Aereni spellcasting isn’t just functional, it’s beautiful. In describing your actions, add details about the grace and artistry of your movements. Namedrop the ancient elves who developed the techniques you’re using today. When you begin using a new ability that you just acquired after gaining a level, your in-character explanation could be that you’ve been practicing this spell for five years, and only just perfected it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tradition versus Innovation</strong> The Aereni cling to the past rather than looking to the future. Do you do the same? Are you working to master the techniques of your ancestors, to find lost artifacts of your line, or are you challenging tradition? Perhaps you have an entirely new idea that you feel could change Aerenal and earn you a place in the Undying Court—but you’ve left Aerenal so you can master it without being discouraged by those who dwell in the past. Or perhaps you don’t yet have a new idea, but you’re convinced that your people need to move forward, and you’re exploring different lands in search of inspiration.</p></li><li><p><strong>New in Town?</strong> If you’re a recent arrival to Khorvaire, you might make a few mistakes based on your experience in your homeland. You could suggest that a priest of the Sovereign Host request an audience with Aureon; after all, you could visit your gods in Shae Mordai for important matters. If a historical figure comes up in conversation, you could suggest speaking with them; surely Galifar or Mishann would be preserved as spirit idols. What kind of fools would let important souls be lost? What do you mean, we can’t just teleport from Sharn to Korth?</p></li><li><p><strong>Vampires Suck</strong>. As Aereni, you’re used to living with the dead, but those deathless are sustained with positive energy. In contrast, the Undying Court teaches that Mabaran undead— negative-energy undead, from skeletons and zombies to liches and vampires—are inherently destructive. Beyond the fact that many of them prey on the living to survive, they’re conduits to Mabar and drain the ambient life from the world simply by existing. It may not be provable, but you believe it’s a concrete environmental threat—have you noticed plants tend to die in places with lots of undead? As someone who’s going to live a long time, your people take these things seriously. While you can put up with their presence if a situation absolutely requires it, you likely consider negative undead a serious threat.</p></li></ul><h2>Aereni Backgrounds</h2><p>As an Aereni elf in Khorvaire, you’re far from home. Are you an exile, an emissary, or a simple tourist? Here are some ways your background might affect your character’s new life.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Acolyte</strong> As an acolyte, you’re a recognized servant of the Undying Court. Temples of the Undying Court are rare in Khorvaire, but they can be found in major cities. Beyond this, you can request minor assistance from any Aereni; they won’t place themselves in danger, but they’ll show respect and support you.</p></li><li><p><strong>Charlatan</strong> and <strong>Criminal</strong> Crime is rare in Aerenal, but these backgrounds can reflect a connection to criminal organizations in Khorvaire. This could be something your family developed for business. It could be tied to your personal history, especially if you’re an exile from Aerenal. Or you could be an agent of the Cairdal Blades—one of their spies—in which case you might be using criminal connections as a source of information.</p></li><li><p><strong>Entertainer</strong> As an entertainer, your Popular Demand feature could reflect your reputation in Aerenal, Khorvaire, or both. Are your performances tied to the traditions of your ancestors or are you creating something new? Are you willing to work with House Phiarlan or House Thuranni—who will want to license any popular act—or do you despise the dragonmarked for abandoning Aerenal, refusing to work with them?</p></li><li><p><strong>Hermit</strong> and <strong>Scholar </strong>Both of these are sound paths for Aereni. An Aereni scholar could make an excellent sage. As a hermit, you may have had a vision from the Undying Court or a glimpse of the Draconic Prophecy that has led you to distant lands.</p></li><li><p><strong>Noble</strong> As a member of a noble line, you weren’t born to your position, you were raised into it. What did you do to earn this honor? You’re seen as one of the most promising members of your line, but you’re also expected to serve the interests of your line and your people; do you embrace this duty? While you may not be a noble of the Five Nations, most of the nations of Khorvaire show great respect to Aereni nobles, and your Position of Privilege should still open doors in high society.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sailor</strong> The line of Melideth are the sailors of the Aereni. While Aerenal has little interest in exploration and remained neutral in the Last War, Melideth traders can be found across the seas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Guard </strong>and <strong>Warrior </strong>You may have served in the armed forces of your line, or you might be a member of the Deathguard, the elite military force tasked to eliminate negative undead (a logical background for a cleric or paladin). Your rank will likely be recognized by any loyal citizen of Aerenal. While you have no authority in the Five Nations, officers may at least respect you as a fellow soldier. On the other hand, as an elf, you’ve had a long life; it could be that you left Aerenal a decade or two ago and served with one of the Five Nations. If so, what drew you into the war? How does your family feel about your actions?</p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":2187500,"name":"The Tairnadal Elves","type":"text","_id":"E7IKWgvU1tTuYoCW","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>The lives of the Tairnadal elves are shaped by those of their patron ancestors. When an elf comes of age, the Keepers of the Past read the signs to determine which of the patron ancestors has laid claim to the child. From that point forward it is the sacred duty of the child to become the living avatar of the fallen champion, mastering his or her skills and living by her code. The people of the Five Nations know little about the Tairnadal, and their general assumptions often don’t make sense. Ask ten people in Sharn, and you’ll hear that the Valenar are bloodthirsty brutes who love to pillage the weak; that they seek glory in battle and won’t fight a weaker foe; that they are bound by a strict code of honor; that they have no honor; that every Valenar is bound to a horse; and so on. In fact, no one rule applies to every Tairnadal, for every ancestor demands a different role of his or her descendants. A child chosen by Maelian Steelweaver will spend his or her days forging swords instead of wielding them. One chosen by Silence will spend life in the shadows. War is the common thread that unites the Tairnadal, because the wars against giants, dragons, and goblins were what produced these legendary heroes. As such, the Tairnadal seek conflicts that will let them face the same odds and fight in the same style as their ancestors. Nowadays a child of Vadallia can’t fight giants, because the Cul’sir Dominion has fallen, but they must search for a foe that is equally challenging and then defeat it in the same way Vadallia would, thus creating new legends in Vadallia’s name.</p></blockquote><p>The island of Aerenal is home to two distinct elven cultures, both of which cling tightly to tradition and the past. The Aereni, ruled by the Undying Court, remain isolated on Aerenal. On the northern steppes of the same island, the nomadic Tairnadal roam—but during the Last War, one of their armies laid claim to the nation of Valenar in Khorvaire, and a sizable Tairnadal contingent remains there today. Driven to emulate their legendary ancestors, Tairnadal elves from either continent can be compelling adventurers. This chapter discusses the patron ancestors that define Tairnadal faith and explores other aspects of Tairnadal society.</p><h2>Tairnadal Faith</h2><p>Tens of thousands of years ago, the Tairnadal came to Aerenal as soldiers—fresh from fighting against the giants of Xen’drik and their minions—and never stood down. Warriors who’d served with fallen champions were determined to honor their heroes by following in their footsteps. Those who were most devoted to this path swore they felt a connection to their idols and believed the spirits of their champions were guiding them. Over the centuries that followed, Tairnadal religious traditions and the Keepers of the Past evolved, but the patron ancestors were with the elves from the start.</p><p>Today, the Tairnadal remain driven and defined by their devotion to their patron ancestors. They believe they preserve these ancestors by emulating their lives, and in doing so, the living Tairnadal receive spiritual guidance. So their faith thrives not only because the Tairnadal want to fulfill their duty to their ancestors, but because they gain practical benefits from that devotion: each elf benefits from the guidance of their patron ancestor, and society benefits from these effective citizens and communal ancestral wisdom.</p><p>When an elf comes of age, the Keepers of the Past determine which ancestor has chosen them. From then on, that elf has a sacred twofold duty: first, to preserve an ancestor through devotion, living as that ancestor did; and second, to allow that champion to walk the world again, acting through the living “revenant” and guiding them. According to Tairnadal doctrine, you can only receive this guidance after an ancestor personally chooses you—and if you refuse that bond, you deny your entire community the chance to benefit from that ancestor’s supernatural guidance. The Tairnadal believe you’ll never be as useful on your own as you could be if you embraced the path of your patron ancestor, and refusing to follow that path is deadly arrogance and selfishness.</p><h2>Patron Ancestors</h2><p>The first patron ancestors fought their giant oppressors during the Age of Giants, battling to liberate their fellow elves then helping them flee when Xen’drik was doomed. However, the Tairnadal didn’t exist yet; these first patron ancestors came from various cultures of the time, long before the Tairnadal culture evolved on the island of Aerenal. The patron Vadallia was a warrior queen, said to have been born in the saddle; many martial traditions of the modern Tairnadal were drawn from her people. In contrast, the patron Cardaen was enslaved and raised in the Cul’sir Dominion; he learned magic in captivity and turned this power against his masters. The first patron ancestors include warriors, slaves, gladiators, and even a feral druid raised by animals in the wild. Some were legendary horsemen and others never rode. As described in this chapter’s opening quote, some of these first heroes had codes of honor and chivalry, while others were infamously cruel—and modern Tairnadal believe their duty is to emulate how their ancestor would act in any situation, whether it forces them to be chivalrous or cruel.</p><p>The first patrons were the champions of ancient Xen’drik, but over the tens of thousands of years since the giants fell, new heroes have arisen. Some Tairnadal patrons fought the Dhakaani goblins when the elves first explored Khorvaire, and others fought dragons who attacked Aerenal. With over twenty thousand years of history to work with, Tairnadal could have fought daelkyr, exposed the schemes of the Lords of Dust, battled sahuagin or krakens, or defeated a plague of undead from Aerenal’s Mabaran manifest zones.</p><h2>Creating a Patron</h2><p>In developing a patron ancestor consider that they are a celebrated, legendary figure. Why do the elves want to ensure this patron is never forgotten? Patrons don’t have to be directly related to the modern elves they choose, though after many thousands of years, most Tairnadal elves are related to many of the patron ancestors. Unlike the kalashtar, you don’t expect your family members to be chosen by the same patron; instead, it’s believed an ancestor chooses you based on your skills and potential. Young Tairnadal essentially spend their youth auditioning for the ancestors; you might’ve honed your skills at stealth in hopes you’ll be chosen by Falaen, or focused on magic expecting to be selected by Cardaen. But ultimately, the patron chooses the elf, and their choice can’t be questioned. As a child with an aptitude for archery, you might expect to be chosen by a legendary archer, only to end up being picked by a brave swordsman—perhaps for your bravery or another aspect of your character you didn’t see as an asset. As you create a patron ancestor for your character, consider how their story will affect your own.</p><p><strong>Legend</strong> The Tairnadal patrons are legends. They become patrons because the elves believe their deeds must not be forgotten and others should follow their example. What did your patron do to earn this devotion? Why are they celebrated and admired? What was their greatest achievement? Did they have a legendary weapon, tool, or treasure they were known for (and if so, are you working to find it)? What was their signature move, spell, or other distinctive thing you can emulate?</p><p><strong>Personality</strong> As a Tairnadal, you’re expected to pattern your personality after your ancestor—including both their strengths and challenges. However, an elf wouldn’t be preserved as a patron ancestor unless their virtues significantly outweighed their flaws. If one of the champions of Xen’drik was known for their cruelty, their positive aspects would have to vastly outweigh it so the Tairnadal are willing to not only overlook this cruelty, but to reenact it to preserve the ancestor’s spirit.</p><p>Despite being beloved and preserved in memory, what were your ancestor’s notable flaws? What about their personality traits, ideals, and bonds? Keep in mind how those might impact your own: has cultivating their traits come easily to you, or are you constantly trying to overcome your own inclinations? For example, if your flaw is your overconfidence, you might be naturally so—or you might try to be overconfident, because that’s something your ancestor was known for.</p><p><strong>Class Features</strong> Patrons are supposed to share their skills with their revenants. Do you see your ancestor as the source of any of your class features—either those you have now or those you’ll eventually gain?</p><p><strong>Relationship with Your Ancestor</strong> Consider what you felt about your patron ancestor when you came of age and were chosen by them. Were you proud to follow in their footsteps? Had you hoped you’d be chosen by them, or did you always imagine you’d be chosen by a different patron? And beyond that, consider what your relationship is like today. Do you value their guidance and believe you’ll create new legends together? Do you feel their presence guiding you, perhaps even having visions while trancing? A strong sense of guidance is especially appropriate for Tairnadal paladins, clerics, or warlocks, but regardless of your class, you might believe the ancestor has a concrete purpose for you.</p><p>As always, work with your DM on how your ancestor’s influence shapes your goals. How will your patron fit into the campaign? Are you trying to find their legendary weapon? Are you driven to defend the innocent or hunt down a particular type of creature? As a Tairnadal, you have a story you’re trying to relive; ideally, it fits into the campaign your DM has in mind, not clashes with it.</p><p><strong>Rivals</strong> There are many more elves than patrons, so most patron ancestors have multiple elves following in their footsteps. How well represented is your patron among the Tairnadal? Are you one of a few, or are there dozens or even hundreds of elves following in their footsteps? What makes you stand out from the others? Do you have a particular rival who’s determined to be a better revenant than you?</p><h2>Living Revenants</h2><p>Any Tairnadal elf who’s bound to a patron ancestor can be referred to as a revenant, based on the idea that the ancestor lives on through them. Once an elf undergoes the rite to determine which ancestor chooses them, it’s their duty as a revenant to emulate this ancestor, perfecting their skills and following in their footsteps.</p><p>Elite revenants who’ve honed this connection and can use it to produce supernatural effects are given the special title of revenant blades; you could create a revenant blade character using the paladin Oath of Veneration presented later in this chapter, or you can describe any class’s features as supernaturally empowered by your ancestor.</p><h3>Trappings of a Revenant</h3><p>Every devout Tairnadal wears an amulet known as a zaelshin—“spirit bond”—that bears the sigil of their ancestor. Some Tairnadal carry a version called the zaelshin tu; this special heirloom contains a relic tied to their patron, such as a sliver of bone, a scrap of cloth, or a tiny piece of a broken blade.</p><p>When performing heroic deeds, a revenant covers their lower face with a veil known as a zaelta, or “spirit mask.” In so doing, the revenant signals to their enemies (and others who see them) that the honor of their achievement goes to the ancestor rather than the living elf. However, most Tairnadal still dream of one day—through their ancestor’s guidance—having their own story become legend. Such living legends still wear the zaelshin of their patron, but they may abandon the zaelta in recognition that their own legend is celebrated as well. Usually, this is done only with the guidance of a Keeper of the Past; it would be extremely arrogant for a Tairnadal to unilaterally decide they’re now the equal of an ancestor.</p><h3>Voice of the Ancestors</h3><p>How exactly does a patron ancestor communicate with a living elf, whether with a Keeper of the Past or a revenant blade? It’s not a straightforward conversation; Shaeras Vadallia couldn’t chat with the spirit of Vadallia about whether to conquer Valenar. However, a patron’s voice can manifest in several ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Instincts</strong> Revenants believe their ancestors are guiding them, and intuition and instinct are considered the hand of the ancestor nudging them in a particular direction. As with many aspects of religion, this is about faith—but the high skill level of the typical Tairnadal warrior suggests that this is more than mere superstition. When a Tairnadal lets instinct guide them, it usually works out well.</p></li><li><p><strong>Trances</strong> Tairnadal elves often interact with their patron ancestors in their trance meditations. They might have visions of training with the ancestor, or they could experience a moment from the ancestor’s memories. Usually this is a passive experience, not unlike a dream; the revenant remembers it when the trance ends, but they can’t stop the training montage to ask Falaen her opinion about current events. However, the context of such a vision could itself be a message; if a revenant keeps having trance-visions about Taeri’s final battle, this might hint at the resting place of his legendary double scimitar.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spells</strong> As suggested earlier, Tairnadal spells and class abilities often reflect ancestral guidance. A Tairnadal wizard may feel as though Cardaen is guiding her as she casts her fireball or studies her spellbook. A paladin could believe the ancestor is guiding their hand when they smite or reaching through to inspire their allies when they cast bless. Spells like augury and divination reflect a more direct interaction with the spirit, though these are likely still conveyed through instinct or vision rather than a mundane conversation.</p></li></ul><p>So as a Tairnadal adventurer, you don’t usually talk directly to your ancestor. Instead, you regularly ask yourself, “what would Vadallia do in this situation?” And when you do, you truly believe she guides you through instinct. And as a DM, you could signal something important to a Tairnadal character via their instincts: “you have a really bad feeling about that Deneith soldier” or “you feel a strong desire to test this minotaur’s strength.” You might even describe a specific vision the character has, but these moments are rare and remarkable.</p><h2>Keepers of the Past</h2><p>The elves of ancient Xen’drik didn’t emulate their ancestors as the Tairnadal do today. The people were devoted to their legendary champions and swore to preserve their memories, but it wasn’t until later that some elves gradually came to believe that the ancestors were still with them, that it was possible to hear the voices of the ancestors and call on them for guidance. These elves were the first Keepers of the Past—the clerics and priests of the Tairnadal—and over time, they evolved rituals for recognizing the bonds between living elves and their patrons, developing the path of the revenant.</p><p>Unlike revenants who emulate a single patron ancestor, the Keepers of the Past can hear all the ancestors and potentially channel any of their gifts. Keepers don’t work to preserve one ancestor; they strive to protect all ancestors and ensure all Tairnadal benefit from their gifts. Despite their central role in Tairnadal society, however, the Keepers of the Past are guides, not rulers. As such, the Tairnadal culture isn’t truly a theocracy; though its foundations rest on a shared faith, the Tairnadal are formally led by lords known as shan (discussed in the “Tairnadal Hierarchy” section). In addition to their religious duties, Keepers of the Past often serve as entertainers; one of their duties is to share the stories of all the ancestors and ensure they’re remembered.</p><h3>Creating a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-deities.pfbk8rqGnj4UDPgh]{Keeper of the Past}</h3><p>The primary domains for a cleric who follows the Keepers of the Past are Confidence, Might, Zeal and Protection and these are sound choices for Keepers who choose to ride with a warband. But for those who live among the zaelantar (see “War and Peace”) and guide the young, there are other options. The alternative domain of Knowledge reflects a Keeper who can draw on the memories of the ancestors. In addition, the Healing alternative domain fits the priest who sees all Tairnadal as their children and strives to protect them all. When playing a Keeper of the Past, consider attributing different spell effects and class features to specific ancestors; you may call on Vadallia to inspire your allies with bless, while you ask Cardaen to smite them with a guiding bolt. Neither of these ancestors have power on their own, but they can act through you. Other options for creating a Keeper of the Past could also be:</p><ul><li><p>A bard, likely with the Warrior Muse.</p></li><li><p>An oracle, with the Ancestors or Battle Mystery</p></li><li><p>A witch, with the Fervor Patron</p></li></ul><p>Again, the primary role of the Keeper is to inspire others and to share the stories of the ancestors.</p><p>When you play a Keeper of the Past as a player character, it’s reasonable to ask why you’ve left your people. Your duty is to guide and inspire the Tairnadal and to preserve the memory of the ancestors; how are you doing that by walking among strangers? Especially if you’re a young Keeper, it’s possible you’ve been given a sacred quest. Perhaps you’ve been sent to recover an artifact of one of the ancestors, or to learn the final fate of a champion who disappeared in the Age of Monsters. Or perhaps you’ve been given a quest by the ancestors themselves, a vision you don’t yet fully understand. Given the long lifespan of the elves, it’s not unreasonable for you to plan on spending a few decades on your quest before returning to your people.</p><p>Ultimately, as a Keeper of the Past, your purpose in your adventuring party includes helping your friends achieve their full potential. You seek to preserve your ancestors, but that’s in part because that ancestral guidance helps Tairnadal become heroes themselves. Even if you’re traveling with non-elves, you may still feel driven to help them become the best versions of themselves.</p><h2>Tairnadal Without Ancestors</h2><p>The Keepers of the Past aren’t selected by any one ancestor; as described earlier in this section, a central part of their role is their ability to hear many ancestors. But are there other Tairnadal who don’t have a patron ancestor?</p><p>Most elves receive an ancestor at around 60, after they undergo a few decades as zaelantar. If you’re a Tairnadal elf of this age (who doesn’t have the gift of the Keepers) but you haven’t been chosen by an ancestor, you essentially haven’t “graduated” yet—so work another decade as zaelantar and try again. Your fellow Tairnadal would assume that if you’re not picked, it’s because you haven’t yet displayed enough value to be chosen; though you’re a disappointment, that doesn’t mean you deserve to be shunned. You simply need to go back to work and do better.</p><p>Though highly unusual, it’s possible that a particular elf might not be picked because all the ancestors wanted them and couldn’t reach an agreement. Perhaps the Tairnadal have a tale of the elf who was thought to be shunned by the ancestors, but who was in fact the most exceptional of all—or perhaps they’ll tell that tale about your player character! But in the overwhelming majority of situations, an unpicked elf would simply continue on as zaelantar until an ancestor eventually chose them.</p><h2>Ancestors of Legend</h2><p>When deciding on your character’s patron ancestor, there are dozens throughout elven history who might choose your character as a revenant. The “Creating a Patron” section gives ideas for how to create your own patron if you’d like them to fit a particular mold—a legendary archer, a perfect paladin—or you can draw inspiration from one of the patrons presented below.</p><h3>Vadallia: Queen of Swords</h3><p>Vadallia was one of the finest warlords of the Age of Giants. She was a gifted equestrian and a deadly warrior, but her greatest talents were her grasp of strategy and her ability to inspire others. She united rival clans and convinced stubborn heroes to join together beneath her banner. She was driven by her passion and her love of the elven people, yet her love was tempered by a lack of compassion for any other creature except her horse.</p><p><strong>Personality</strong> The Tairnadal expect Vadallia revenants to be leaders, inspiring their comrades and devising clever strategies to defeat their enemies. While Vadallias are expected to be utterly devoted to their warband and their people, they are known for ruthless expediency with enemies. This can be seen in the actions of High King Shaeras Vadallia, who betrayed Cyre’s trust and seized what's now Valenar … but in so doing, brilliantly secured the land for the elves. If you play a Vadallia revenant, do you agree with Shaeras’s decision and believe Vadallia herself would’ve done the same thing? Or do you believe the High King’s actions show him to be an imperfect avatar of the Queen of Swords?</p><p><strong>Character Options</strong> Vadallia revenants are typically martial characters. A fighter might highlight her strategic brilliance, while an paladin champion showcases her skill with horses and in inspiring allies.</p><p><strong>Artifacts</strong> It’s said that one of Vadallia’s eyes was a diamond through which she could see glimpses of the future. Her double scimitar is also a legendary weapon, and would be a remarkable artifact for a revenant to discover. Currently Shaeras Vadallia is seen as the predominant avatar of the Queen of Swords, but someone who acquires one of these might be able to challenge the High King.</p><h3>Cardaen</h3><p>Cardaen is an arcane prodigy, raised by giants and taught to love magic above all else. In his early life, he was completely absorbed with study. He had no interest in how the rituals he crafted were used; he simply sought to push the laws of magic to their limits. After Vadallia’s death, he realized that magic was pointless if it didn't have purpose. He dedicated his life to vengeance, hunting down and punishing those who brought suffering to his people.</p><p><strong>Personality</strong> Cardaen is widely considered to be one of the greatest elf wizards of history, commanding respect from the Aereni and Tairnadal alike. Some Cardaens are cold and dispassionate, while others see beauty in magic, but all are known for their intellectual pursuits. Some Tairnadal say that to be a true revenant of his, an elf must begin with an innocent love of magic and be hardened by a terrible loss. Following his legacy, Cardaen revenants may choose two very different paths—that of zaeltairn or zaelantar, war or peace, as discussed in the “Tairnadal Society” section. Those who choose to be warriors tend to embrace Cardaen’s vengeful nature in defense of their people. But others choose the settled life and focus on arcane research in the few cities of the Tairnadal. While “peaceful” by comparison, such revenants are typically cold-blooded in their use of magic.</p><p><strong>Character Options</strong> Many of Cardaen’s revenants are wizards and sages, as Cardaen’s greatest strength was his towering intellect; a Cardaen might focus on developing spells and arcane weapons to support the warbands. While it would be unusual, an Inventor could certainly draw inspiration from him. Other Cardaen revenants who wield magic on the battlefield could be an Eldritch Archer or a Magus.</p><p><strong>Artifacts</strong> Cardaen died in Xen’drik before the exodus, and his spellbook has never been found; it’s possible it contains spells he never shared with others. His staff was a powerful magical weapon, and it is also lost to time. Over the centuries, explorers and scholars have occasionally found spell scrolls written by this great wizard, and one might surface in Xen’drik or elsewhere.</p><h3>Falaen: the Silence</h3><p>Falaen was the deadliest assassin of the Age of Giants, known as “the Silence” both for her skills at stilling tongues and for her taciturn persona. Much about her is a mystery, as suits a figure who lived in the shadows. Falaen grew up among the drow and was trained to kill her own kind; most stories say the drow took her after they killed her family, but some maintain she was at least part drow herself. What's certain is that she turned against the drow and their giant masters, and that during the Silence’s war in the shadows, she brought down countless drow and struck deep inside enemy lines.</p><p><strong>Personality</strong> By all accounts, Falaen was ruthless but never cruel; she viewed her work as necessary but took no joy in killing, and her revenants usually share that perspective. She was endlessly patient, and similarly, her revenants sometimes wait weeks or months until seizing the perfect moment to bring down their prey. Unlike many Tairnadal, Falaen revenants usually avoid horses, as she had no love for the creatures.</p><p><strong>Character Options</strong> Falaen revenants tend to be rogues or rangers, but some follow other paths. While a Tairnadal warband might have a single Falaen revenant who serves as a Scout rogue, there are also several “Silent Bands” comprised entirely of her revenants, specializing in long-term covert operations.</p><p><strong>Artifacts</strong> Falaen specialized in two light blades, and either her weapons, her mask, or her legendary cloak of shadows would be prized artifacts for a revenant to recover.</p><h3>Taeri</h3><p>Where Vadallia was known for her strategy, Taeri is celebrated for his sheer prowess on the battlefield. Some scholars liken him to an elf analogue of Dol Dorn, emphasizing the virtues of courage and skill. Taeri was a master of melee combat in all its forms, but he is particularly celebrated as the greatest wielder of the double scimitar who’s ever lived; most modern scimitar forms are still drawn from his teachings. Though renowned for his skill with melee weapons, Taeri is said to have never touched a bow.</p><p>While Taeri is exceptional, there are certainly other patrons who follow his mold—ancestors renowned for their courage and skill with a particular weapon, whose revenants are always seeking greater challenges to prove themselves. Quite a few of Taeri’s revenants have become patrons themselves: Daealyth was a Taeri revenant who accomplished great deeds in her battles with the Dhakaani goblins, while Haetar Taeri fought dragons and is one of the primary patrons of the Draleus Tairn.</p><p><strong>Personality</strong> Many modern Tairnadal stereotypes are rooted in Taeri’s legacy: he’s known for always seeking a greater challenge and refusing to take advantage of a weaker foe. On more than one occasion, he let an opponent live when they threw down their weapons and refused to fight him. While celebrated for his skill, Taeri is notably not known for his cunning; stories tell of him being outwitted by clever drow, or being the lone survivor of an ambush that Vadallia would have surely anticipated.</p><p><strong>Character Options</strong> Taeri’s revenants could be fighters, rangers, paladins, or even monks; several legends tell of a disarmed Taeri defeating his enemies with his bare hands. However, he's celebrated first and foremost for his skill with the double scimitar, and most of his revenants are skilled with that or similar martial weapons.</p><p><strong>Artifacts</strong> Anyone who could recover Taeri’s legendary double scimitar would secure a place in song and story. His chainmail was shattered and scattered, but many Taeri revenants carry a link of his armor.</p><h3>Vaela the Wolf</h3><p>There are many legendary druids and rangers among the Tairnadal. One of these, Maezan the Thunderhand, raised the briar walls of Taer Valaestas during the Age of Monsters. Maezan was himself a revenant of the druid Shal; meanwhile, Shal was inspired by Vaela the Wolf, whose legends date back to the earliest days of that age. When Vaela was only a child, their village was destroyed by giants and their people were taken as prisoners. Vaela alone escaped into the jungle. They should’ve died, but they forged a bond to the beasts of the wild; it’s said that when they encountered a pack of wolves, Vaela instinctively became a wolf, and grew up among them. As Vaela the Wolf grew older, they shifted from form to form, living with every beast in the jungle and learning their secrets. Eventually, Vaela came upon another band of giant raiders who were hunting elves. Vaela slaughtered the giants and joined the elves, assuming an elven form just as they’d assumed so many beast forms in the past. Along the way, Vaela remembered their past and realized they were elven, though it took them a long time to decide what that meant and who Vaela the Elf would be. Vaela taught many elves the secrets of the wild; some became rangers, while others followed more closely in Vaela’s footsteps and became the first of the Gyrderi druids.</p><p><strong>Personality</strong> Though druid revenants of later generations—including those of Shul and Maezan—have shifted away from their feral roots, Vaela is pure and primal. Their revenants prefer to live surrounded by untamed nature, and for them, concepts like gender, family, and national identity are often fluid, though they still deeply value their Tairnadal heritage and strive to preserve Vaela’s spirit. One Silaes Tairn warband, formed entirely of Vaela revenants, functions much like a pack of wolves. However, it’s not uncommon for Vaela revenants to leave their warband for a time to learn the ways of another culture, or even to live alongside a particular beast and learn its ways.</p><p><strong>Character Options</strong> Their revenants tend to be wild order druids, more comfortable in beast form than on two legs; however, some become Beast Masters, Rangers, Barbarians, or other classes closely tied to primal nature.</p><p><strong>Artifacts</strong> Vaela trusted their teeth and hide over weapons and armor. Vaela’s teeth are infused with their power and, if they still exist, would be highly sought after by their revenants.</p><h2>Tairnadal Society</h2><p>The people of the Five Nations are used to dealing with the Tairnadal as individuals, whether as lone mercenaries or members of a warband. Yet even while they are spread across the world, the Tairnadal are still part of a single nation. Here are some key elements of Tairnadal society that shape their lives on Aerenal and beyond it.</p><h3>War and Peace</h3><p>Tairnadal culture is based on people emulating the lives of their patron ancestors. But these ancestors became legends by fighting a guerrilla war, and to follow their example, the Tairnadal elves have been engaging in complex wargames for tens of thousands of years. While Tairnadal combatants spare enemies when possible—you don’t finish off a fallen foe—there is no point to a battle that doesn’t truly test the skills of the combatants, so battles are fought with deadly spells and steel. Building on this foundation, Tairnadal civilization has developed into two basic aspects: peace and war, zaelantar and zaeltairn.</p><p><strong>Zaelantar </strong>The zaelantar—“peaceful souls”—maintain the civilian infrastructure, raising and training both young elves and beasts of war and burden. They craft weapons and tools, and they maintain the settled communities of the steppes. The bulk of the zaelantar are young elves— Tairnadal elves receive a patron ancestor when they come of age, which usually doesn’t happen until an elf is at least sixty. Before that, Tairnadal spend decades of their lives training in basic skills, studying Tairnadal history, and maintaining their community, including caring for younger elves. Through this process, each elf is effectively auditioning to the patron ancestors. The young elf who excels at hunting expects to be chosen by a legendary archer or stalker, while the elf who becomes a community leader hopes to be chosen by one of the great leaders of the past.</p><p>While waiting for a patron to choose them, these elves spend at least four decades of what humans would consider adult life working in a zaelantar community, performing necessary tasks until they’re set on a different path. Other zaelantar include former zaeltairn who are unable to fight due to age or infirmity, but who can teach the young. The Keepers of the Past are largely zaelantar, serving to train and guide. And finally, the zaelantar include adults chosen by patron ancestors whose legendary skills are tied to the civic sphere: fabled smiths, legendary teachers, the Siyal Marrain (druids who tend the beasts), and so on.</p><p><strong>Zaeltairn </strong>Meanwhile, the zaeltairn—“warrior souls”—serve in an army and fight the Tairnadal’s endless war, emulating their ancestors in the field. Zaeltairn are split into armies, each of which is further divided into clans and bands. These assignments and duties aren’t temporary; once assigned to an army, Tairnadal serve until they die or until they retire (or are forced to retire) to train the young. A Tairnadal army effectively functions as a nomadic city-state; most patron ancestors were guerrilla soldiers and mobility was vital, thus most Tairnadal armies are nomadic, following migratory paths across the steppes. A few armies remain settled, however, based on the specialties of the ancestors represented by the army. Notably, each of the great jungles of the region—around Shae Thoridor and Var-Shalas—is home to an army, whose members specialize in jungle warfare and commando operations.</p><h3>Tairnadal Cities</h3><p>Among the Tairnadal, the zaeltairn are nomadic while the zaelantar live in village communities. Three great Tairnadal cities stand in the northern region of Aerenal:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Var-Shalas</strong> is the largest city of the Tairnadal, surrounded by walls of bronzewood thorns (similar to Taer Valaestas in Valenar). In addition to being the stronghold of the Keepers of the Past, the Shanutar conducts council business here (see “Shanutar: Council of Lords”).</p></li><li><p><strong>Shae Thoridor</strong> is the greatest city of the zaelantar. It is smaller than Var-Shalas, though similar in construction, but is nonetheless an important seat of the Keepers of the Past and an industrial center for the goods required by the armies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Taer Senadal</strong> is a stone fortress—but an unusual one. Rather than being built to defend the region from attack, this fortress is designed to be attacked. Taer Senadal is defended by youths in the late stages of their training, and it lives up to its name, loosely translated as “fortress of whetstone.” Here, armies take turns attacking the fortress, allowing the youths to hone their skills as they defend it, while the army practices assaulting fortifications.</p></li></ul><p>The Tairnadal elves known as the Valaes Tairn have also laid claim to Valenar in Khorvaire. There, they occupy the cities of Taer Valaestas and Pylas Maradal, though their warbands remain largely nomadic.</p><h3>Tairnadal Hierarchy</h3><p>The Aereni are ruled by the Undying Court and the Sibling Kings, while Valenar has a “High King.” But what of the Tairnadal of Aerenal? No single monarch or high priest leads the Tairnadal, and as mentioned earlier, the culture isn’t strictly a theocracy, despite being founded on faith. Instead, the basic leadership role within the Tairnadal is the shan, loosely translated as “lord.” Each rank of shan can be held by any Tairnadal, with no restrictions on gender or blood.</p><p><strong>Civilian Hierarchy - </strong>Among the zaelantar, the title tar-shan—“peace lord”—is used for either a village leader or someone who oversees a district of one of the great cities. In the cities, the tarshans of each district confer on matters affecting the full city, rather than appointing a single city leader. On a smaller scale, a band of youths is guided by one of their peers known as an an-shan—“young lord.”</p><p><strong>Military Hierarchy -</strong> While the structure of Tairnadal society is relentlessly martial, they don’t have a complex hierarchy of ranks. Most Tairnadal armies follow a similar structure to the Valenar.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Armies and Var-Shans</strong> Among the zaeltairn, the highest recognized rank is the var-shan—“great lord”— who leads an entire army. The people of the Five Nations often characterize Shaeras Vadallia as a “High King,” but this is largely a translation error. Shaeras is actually a var-shan, making him the Great Lord of the Army of Valenar. As the only var-shan in Khorvaire, Shaeras is the highest-ranking Tairnadal on the continent, but each Tairnadal army has a var-shan of its own.</p></li><li><p><strong>Warclans &amp; Shans</strong> The Army of Valenar has fortyfive warclans in Khorvaire, each of which has several hundred elves. The clan leaders are known simply as shans. At any given time, twenty of these clans are under the direct command of var-shan Shaeras Vadallia, while the rest are active in the field. The same is true for the armies in Aerenal: each army has a core of clans that remain close and under the direct command of the var-shan, while others follow general directions but operate independently.</p></li><li><p><strong>Warbands &amp; Lu-Shans</strong> Within each clan, some bands remain under the direct command of the shan, while others may be dispersed on independent operations like scouting or harrying enemies. Each band is led by a lu-shan—“band lord.”</p><p>Warbands are essentially families whose members serve together indefinitely. When there is a split-second military decision to be made, the lu-shan commands and their word can't be questioned. But if there are other issues, the band debates them around the campfire and consensus generally rules; the lu-shan has the final say, but it’s rare for a lu-shan to veto the decisions of the band without clear military reason. And on the rare occasions they do veto, the band respects the decision not for the title alone, but because they respect the lu-shan as a person—and as a revenant of a particular ancestor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ancestral Authority</strong> Those appointed to leadership roles are elves channeling the spirits of legendary leaders. Within a clan, of course the Vadallia revenant is the lu-shan, because she’s channeling Vadallia! Taeri is a peerless swordsman, but he’s not a leader; who would even think of appointing a Taeri as shan? Beyond the authority of an individual leader, the word of another respected revenant carries a great deal of weight in matters related to that ancestor’s expertise. For example, a Vadallia lu-shan is generally a good war leader, but when planning an ambush, they may defer to the Falaen revenant, trusting their expertise in matters of stealth and cunning.</p><p>This overall structure flows upstream. If a clan’s shan issues a command, it must be obeyed—but unless it’s an urgent matter, the shan first seeks the consensus of their lu-shans. Or if it isn’t a question of war, they seek the guidance of Keepers of the Past or even the local tar-shan. Beyond this, each army dispatches two clans to VarShalas and one to Shae Thoridor. These clans protect the cities, but the shans also represent their army in the Shanutar.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Shanutar: Council of Lords - </strong>Var-Shalas is home to the Shanutar—the Council of Lords—which brings together both zaelantar and zaeltairn leaders. This isn’t a ruling body, but a place for the lords of the armies and villages to share news and resolve grievances. The Keepers of the Past mediate the Shanutar; each village’s tar-shan has a place on the council, and each army is represented by the two shans whose clans are stationed at Var-Shalas.</p><p><strong>Consensus in Leadership</strong> - So ultimately, who leads the Tairnadal? When decisions must be made in a moment, the present ranking leader’s word is absolute, regardless of whether they’re the varshan, shan, or lu-shan. In other matters, the Tairnadal seek consensus—whether a lu-shan consulting with their band, a shan seeking consensus from the lu-shans, or the var-shan consulting the shans. Beyond this, people respect the ancestors that are channeled; they look to those guided by ancient leaders to channel that wisdom.</p><h3>Internal Differences</h3><p>Tairnadal culture has little room for internal dissent. It’s effectively a highly disciplined army that’s further united by deep devotion to a shared religion, compounded by the overall elven dedication to tradition. This is reflected by the fact that the civilization has stood, virtually unchanged, for over twenty thousand years. On the one hand, this reflects unity and stability; on the other hand, it also reflects the general stagnation of Aerenal.</p><p>The Tairnadal are effectively an army, broken into a clearly defined system of warclans and warbands. The endless training exercises conducted between these units provides an outlet for competition within the culture, as does the rivalry between revenants striving to be the best avatars of their patron ancestors. There’s potential for tension between revenants based on the morals of their ancestors—the chivalrous defender of the weak and the ruthless assassin—but these stories are well known and shans are careful to assign such revenants to different bands. So there is friendly competition within the confines of the culture, but people who truly don’t fit in are expelled from the society, typically fostered to the Aereni.</p><p><strong>Valaes Tairn, Silaes Tairn, and Draleus Tairn</strong></p><p>The Tairnadal do have some philosophical divisions, and canon identifies three significant Tairnadal subcultures:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The Valaes Tairn</strong> seek glory in battle; this subculture is the one most Five Nations people think of when you say “Tairnadal.” They comprise the majority of the Tairnadal; they're represented by at least three armies within Aerenal, and the large army occupying Valenar is also Valaes Tairn.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Silaes Tairn</strong> believe that true glory can only be found in Xen’drik; their single army has twenty-one warclans, most of which remain in Aerenal, but at any given time there are four Silaes warclans active in Xen’drik. The giants of Xen’drik are no longer the mighty enemies their ancestors fought, but Silaes warriors pit their skills against the deadliest threats Xen’drik has to offer, and search for artifacts and relics of their patron ancestors.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Draleus Tairn</strong> are the smallest army, with only five warclans, but they are widely believed to be the deadliest warriors of all. Aerenal has suffered many draconic attacks over the centuries, and the Draleus Tairn are always preparing—and yearning—for the next battle. Some say that the Draleus Tairn hunt rogue and feral dragons across Eberron, and there are even stories of Draleus champions venturing into the vast plains of Argonnessen.</p></li></ul><p>These long-established sects have coexisted for millennia and share many traditions. However, there is one major point of conflict, especially within the Valaes Tairn: “do you support the Valenar initiative?” While warclans from every Valaes Tairn army joined Shaeras’s expedition, many other warclans chose to remain in Aerenal and disapprove of his actions.</p><h3>Families and Warbands</h3><p>Given the relentlessly martial nature of Tairnadal society, it’s reasonable to wonder how families work within the Tairnadal. Do parents carry their children with them in a warband? Are familial relations important? The answers to these questions are “no” and “not very.”</p><p><strong>Family Ties</strong></p><p>Who your parents are is far less important than who your patron ancestor is. Tairnadal don’t maintain property, so you’re not passing your holdings down to a child. And the Tairnadal don’t use family names: each Tairnadal elf uses a given name followed by the name of their patron ancestor. So Shaeras Vadallia may have been the son of Jael Cardaen and Sol Taeri, but ultimately, that doesn’t matter. A child is given to the zaelantar to be raised, and they become an adult when chosen by a patron ancestor.</p><p>With that said, the Keepers of the Past keep records, and most Tairnadal know who their parents are; given their long elven lives, it’s even possible that a freshly trained warrior could be assigned to a warband that contains a relative. So as a Tairnadal, you might serve with a relative and feel a strong attachment, but on a societal level, your personal lineage isn’t as significant as your spiritual lineage.</p><p><strong>Warbands</strong></p><p>The people you’re closest to are the other members of your warband, who you may serve alongside for many decades or even centuries. Warbands (composed of eight to twelve warriors) are trained to be self-sufficient, and given the nomadic nature of Tairnadal life, the other members of a warband are the only reliable social contact a Tairnadal has through much of their existence. Members of a warband are essentially fighting an endless war, so they have to be able to work together and to trust one another. The band works together to settle any feuds and disagreements internally.</p><p>Though warbands can be made up of elves with the same spiritual lineage, this practice is very rare. Keep in mind that ancestors are essentially military specialties: Vadallia is a leader, Cardaen provides arcane support, and Taeri specializes in melee. You’ll rarely find a warband that has more than one Vadallia, because what’s the point of having two leaders? Most warbands have a versatile blend of patron ancestors that serve the needs of the unit. A warband with a highly specialized function—a band of archers or a commando unit specializing in urban infiltration—may have multiple elves that follow the same ancestor because that overlap of skills is desirable for that purpose.</p><p>The shans are very careful in who they assign to which warband, in part because some patron ancestors have stories that are fundamentally at odds; you don’t want to put someone whose patron is known for chivalry and honor in the same warband with a patron known for ruthless cruelty. This contributes to the conflicting impressions of the Valenar within the Five Nations: some say they adhere to a strict code of honor, while others say they are brutal and cruel. Both stories are true; they’re just describing warbands driven by different patron ancestors.</p><p><strong>Half-Elves and the Tairnadal</strong></p><p>Though uncommon, some half-elves live among the Tairnadal; the Tairnadal attitude toward these Khoravar is that they’re children who can never grow up, due to no fault of their own. The Tairnadal believe that no Khoravar can channel a patron ancestor—and thus far, they’ve never been proven wrong. Khoravar are seen as having a connection to their people, and they’re happy to have Khoravar serve as zaelantar, performing civilian tasks in the peaceful cities. But these half-elves can never be chosen by an ancestor, and thus they can never be zaeltairn.

The winner of the competition was Keith Baker with the Eberron Campaign Setting. In 2005 after developing the setting in concert with Wizards of the Coast, the Eberron campaign setting was published for Dungeons and Dragons 3e.</span></p><p style=\"padding:0px;width:643.891px;color:#000000;font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif;font-size:14px;margin:var(--p-space,1em) auto 0px auto;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif\">Eberron is a pulp action world where morality is a shade of grey, but the call to adventure is always present. Adventure is everywhere, from the continent of Khorvaire: where arcane industry powered a hundred-year-war which now stands in an uneasy truce gone cold war; to Xen'drik where ancient ruins of the giant civilization wait to be discovered; there are many backdrops for a story in Eberron - and equally many dangers. Some of these dangers threaten nations, while others put the fate of the world at risk. Only a few legendary people can ever hope to stand against these threats, which is where the PCs come in. The need for heroes is desperate, but there is hope.</span></p><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"https://www.freexenon.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Huge-battle-scene-on-a-lightning-rail-with-a-Talenta-halfling-riding-a-2-weapon-wielding-Warforged-soldier-and-a-gobling-artificer-being-a-1.jpg\" width=\"650\" height=\"227\" /><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Magic &amp; Technology</span></h3><p style=\"margin:0px auto;padding:0px;width:643.891px;color:#000000;font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif;font-size:14px;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif\">Eberron is a world of magical industry. Artificers and wizards fill a similar role to our own world’s engineers and scientists, using schools of magic instead of scientific disciplines. However, Eberron is not a “high magic” setting. Spells above third level are rare in Khorvaire, with such magic generally only available to the wealthy. Magic above fifth level is a thing of legends. Instead, Khorvaire is defined by its application of everyday “wide magic” - clever use of cantrips and low-level spells to make life easier.</span></p><p style=\"padding:0px;width:643.891px;color:#000000;font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif;font-size:14px;margin:var(--p-space,1em) auto 0px auto;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif\">While Eberron has a similar aesthetic to steampunk and related genres, it isn’t a world of mundane technology, steam power, clockwork constructs, and the like. The Eberron setting is built on the assumption that in a world with pervasive lowlevel magic, there would be little need for mundane inventions because magic has taken their place. So instead of the linear advancements of steampunk settings that mirror the real world, Eberron can be a world without mundane technology due to the pervasiveness of arcane technology. For example, the trains don’t need to run on steam or electric power - not because of a primitive understanding of science, but because you don’t need steam if you can bind powerful elementals in Khyber dragonshards and tap their power instead.</span></p><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"https://www.worldanvil.com/uploads/images/236ddf7aab6123042ec14118edabc4cd.jpg\" width=\"650\" height=\"242\" /><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Industry &amp; Commerce</span></h3><p style=\"margin:0px auto;padding:0px;width:643.891px;color:#000000;font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif;font-size:14px;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif\">Despite the distinction in what powers technologies in Eberron—magical advancements instead of mundane ones - many industries of Khorvaire feel similar to our own world at the turn of the 19th to the 20th century. </span></p><p style=\"padding:0px;width:643.891px;color:#000000;font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif;font-size:14px;margin:var(--p-space,1em) auto 0px auto;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif\">While the dragonmarked houses might bring to mind the dystopian corporations of cyberpunk, they actually reflect a much older economic organization: medieval guilds.

In cosmic horror, the actions of the heroes are futile in the face of an inevitable eldritch future. In Eberron, spells and steel can stop antediluvian horrors. Villains may weave dastardly schemes, but they can be defeated in a final high-stakes confrontation.</span></p><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"https://yawningportal.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/AwesomeSahuaginAttack.jpg\" width=\"650\" height=\"229\" /><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Wandslingers</span></h3><p style=\"margin:0px auto;padding:0px;width:643.891px;color:#000000;font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif;font-size:14px;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif\">The frontier of Q’barra is patrolled by roving wandslingers, dispensing justice and mediating disputes. The battlefields of the Last War were fought not only by warriors with sword and shield, but by wandslingers hurling spells across enemy lines. While a wand can be a toy or tool, it is also a weapon, and wizards who openly carry a wand are publicly representing their threat. Put simply - there are no guns in Eberron, but the advances of magic have made gunpowder unnecessary - why spend centuries refining a dangerous chemical compound when magic constantly provides an easier solution with wands that never jam or backfire?</span></p><p style=\"margin:0px auto;padding:0px;width:643.891px;color:#000000;font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif;font-size:14px;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif\"> </span></p><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"https://www.worldanvil.com/media/cache/cover/uploads/images/82eaad3bf65730705b28204044a8b701.png\" width=\"650\" height=\"312\" /><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">The Last War</span></h3><p style=\"margin:0px auto;padding:0px;width:643.891px;color:#000000;font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif;font-size:14px;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif\">The continent of Khorvaire has just emerged from a century of war, which included periods of intense conflict intermixed with times of uneasily glaring at each other across borders. Nations lost territory, gained, and lost again, and several new nations were established from land seized from others. With shifting allegiances throughout the century of conflict, nearly every nation has considered all its neighbors enemies at some point. Though hostilities ceased with the Treaty of Thronehold and the nations are rebuilding relationships with their neighbors, the memory of tensions has not faded.</span></p><p style=\"padding:0px;width:643.891px;color:#000000;font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif;font-size:14px;margin:var(--p-space,1em) auto 0px auto;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif\">However, the dragonmarked houses have ensured some measure of stability, remaining neutral throughout the conflict.

The battlefield was controlled by archers and wandslingers, not ranks of riflemen. Artillery was dominated not by mundane cannons, but by massive siege staffs—wands made out of whole tree trunks.</span></p><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"https://yawningportal.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/eberron.jpg\" width=\"650\" height=\"233\" /><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Sentient Constructs</span></h3><p style=\"margin:0px auto;padding:0px;width:643.891px;color:#000000;font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif;font-size:14px;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif\">Classical fantasy settings often feature soulless golems and constructs crafted by wizards, powered by alchemy or other magic. Steampunk settings expand on this with clockwork automatons using gears, wires, and an oil can to keep everything running smoothly. Cyberpunk settings spotlight high-tech robots with advanced artificial intelligence.</span></p><p style=\"padding:0px;width:643.891px;color:#000000;font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif;font-size:14px;margin:var(--p-space,1em) auto 0px auto;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif\">In Eberron, the warforged are magically animated, but they’re no mere constructs nor clockwork devices. Beneath their armored exterior, warforged are made of living wood that functions as muscle, bone, and central nervous system. Warforged are not artificial intelligences, but fully sentient, with the same capacity for love, fear, and faith as any other person.</span></p><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"https://yawningportal.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/eb9title.jpg\" width=\"650\" height=\"231\" /><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Shades of Gray</span></h3><p style=\"margin:0px auto;padding:0px;width:643.891px;color:#000000;font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif;font-size:14px;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif\">People in Eberron are neither paragons of virtue nor vile exemplars. Even the jovial barkeep may water down his ale, an evil act of fraud. Villains have motivations beyond “They hate everyone, especially puppies.” Community leaders might do the right thing for all the wrong reasons.</span></p><p style=\"padding:0px;width:643.891px;color:#000000;font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif;font-size:14px;margin:var(--p-space,1em) auto 0px auto;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif\">While Eberron does not disregard alignment entirely, few creatures have fixed alignment. Traditional “monstrous” races, like goblins and harpies, are no more inclined to evil than dwarves or halflings, and while nations of monstrous creatures might be unfamiliar and uncomfortable to people from the Five Nations, its residents are not inherently evil. The only mortals bound to a certain alignment are those cursed with lycanthropy. Otherwise, all are free to live and act as they please, for good or evil. Immortal beings—whose existence flows from the distilled essence of their planes—usually fall within traditional alignments of good and evil, but even so, celestials can fall and fiends can rise.</span></p><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0a2620_9b8c5c92086a49f29397764dd450baab.jpg/v1/fill/w_907,h_342,al_c,q_90/0a2620_9b8c5c92086a49f29397764dd450baab.webp\" width=\"650\" height=\"245\" /><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Distant Deities</span></h3><p style=\"margin:0px auto;padding:0px;width:643.891px;color:#000000;font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif;font-size:14px;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif\">The gods of Eberron are distant, if they exist at all, and they certainly don’t walk the face of the earth. All souls, good and evil, fade away in Dolurrh together. Without cosmic forces of divinity shaping each moment, mortal souls choose their own destiny. Even a powerful cleric of the Sovereign Host can’t prove the presence of the Host, but believes they are ever-present, such as viewing Onatar’s existence as every strike of a hammer on the forge. Spells that commune with deities in other settings instead might reach powerful outsiders, who may have godlike powers but are only deities by merit of those that give them worship—and those powerful outsiders have no concrete proof of the existence of greater powers either. In Eberron, religion is truly a matter of faith, not sight.</span></p><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.sageadvice.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/eberron12.jpg\" width=\"650\" height=\"340\" /><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">The Draconic Prophecy</span></h3><p style=\"margin:0px auto;padding:0px;width:643.891px;color:#000000;font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif;font-size:14px;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Vollkorn, Eczar, Georgia, serif\">The Draconic Prophecy appears everywhere: in the sky, on the ground, in the pattern of streams flowing over sand, and, more recently, on mortals in the form of dragonmarks.

Eberron is not a steampunk setting with gunpowder and electricity. Instead, wandslingers roam the Q'barran frontier, dueling at high noon. Low-level utility magic is common and improves the lives of the many. High level magic and archmages are extraordinarily rare and still maintain their mysticism and wonder.</p><h2>A World of Adventure</h2><p>Every location in Eberron has been crafted to inspire DMs with plot hooks while still melding together logically. Eberron threads the needle between kitchen sink and a one-note world.</p><h2>A World of Intrigue</h2><p>Eberron is full of unanswered mysteries, most prominently the true cause of the Mourning. Dozens and dozens of factions scheme to increase their influence, hunting for power wherever they can find it.</p><h2>The Last War has ended - sort of</h2><p>Two years ago, twelve nations came together to sign the Thronehold accords to end a war that had lasted a century. Still, tensions are high as the only thing that brought them together is the fear of a second Mourning, a magical disaster that completely wiped the country of Cyre off the map.</p><h2>The Draconic Prophecy</h2><p>The creation of the world came with mystic secrets wrapped into every crevice. The demons and dragons each seek to manipulate and control the prophecy, setting in motion schemes that may take centuries.</p><h2>The Five Nations</h2><p>The Kingdom of Galifar was composed of five provinces, shattered by the Last War. Four of these human-dominated nations survive - Aundair, Breland, Thrane, Karrnath. Cyre, the heart and jewel of Galifar, has fallen to the dead-gray mists and is now known as the Mournland.</p><h2>Dragonmark Dynasties</h2><p>Twelve lines of common races - humans, dwarves, elves, halflings, gnomes, half orcs and half elves - bear mystic symbols granting innate arcane power. Over the millenia the houses have grown to dominate industry, providing licensing and training while pushing out competition. </p><h2>Dragonshards</h2><p>Imbued with mystic power, these natural resources fuel the arcane advancements of Khorvaire. Alleged to be the crystallized blood of progenitors, Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber shards can be difficult and dangerous to acquire.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Common Knowledge","type":"text","_id":"LqY0Es9j8PylWVIh","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>Eberron sourcebooks provide us a source of absolute knowledge. As players and DMs, we know about the Lords of Dust and the Dreaming Dark. We know about the giants of Xen’drik and that they fought the quori. Our adventurers may also know these things if they succeed on appropriate ability checks; if a character wants to recall details of the conflict between the Dhakaani and the daelkyr, they might make an Recall Knowledge check. But what do people know without making any ability checks? What things are just common knowledge? If an adventurer mentions the Lords of Dust in a tavern, do other patrons know what they’re talking about?</p></blockquote><p>This article discusses much of the common knowledge of a citizen of the Five Nations. For other cultures, DMs will have to combine this foundation with common sense to account for the variances in common knowledge: Stormreachers know more about drow than Aundairians do. Shadow Marchers have heard of the Gatekeepers, while most Karrns haven’t. People living in a region probably have common knowledge about the things that impact their lives there—the people of the Mror Holds don’t know much about the daelkyr in general, but they do know about Dyrrn the Corruptor, because they’ve been fighting him for decades and he signed his name with Dyrrn’s Promise in 943 YK.</p><h1>Religion</h1><p>Gods don’t walk the world in Eberron, and the existence of the divine is a matter of faith. But even if you don’t believe in anything you can’t touch, you’ll still know some basic details about the faiths of Eberron.</p><h2>The Creation Myth</h2><p>Everyone knows the basic creation myth: Khyber, Eberron, and Siberys created the planes. Khyber killed Siberys and scattered his pieces in the sky, creating the Ring of Siberys. Eberron enfolded Khyber and became the world. Some people believe this is literally true while others consider it metaphor, but everyone understands that magic comes from Siberys, natural creatures come from Eberron, and fiends and other evil things come from Khyber.</p><h2>The Sovereign Host</h2><p>The Sovereign Host is deeply ingrained into daily life in the Five Nations. Even people who don’t believe in the Sovereigns know the names and basic attributes of the Nine and Six, and you don’t have to be a Vassal to take part in the festivities of Aureon’s Crown or Bounty’s Blessing. Likewise, everyone knows that in the dawn of time, demons ruled the world, the Sovereigns fought them, and the demons were bound by the Silver Flame. Because of this, some Vassals actually believe the Sovereigns created the Silver Flame—it’s just the light of Dol Arrah, and templars are fools for not seeing this.</p><p>The Dark Six are widely known by their titles—the Mockery, the Keeper—but their original names—Dol Azur, Kol Turrant—are usually only known by those with ties to a relevant cult or proficiency in Religion.</p><h2>The Silver Flame</h2><p>For hundreds of years, the Church of the Silver Flame has been a significant force within the Five Nations. Even citizens who don’t worship the Silver Flame recognize it as a force that binds demons, and its templars are known as soldiers devoted to protecting the innocent from supernatural evil.</p><p>Prior to the Last War, local law enforcement commonly worked with templars to combat supernatural threats. However, the Last War undermined trust in the templars (though most people understand that templars are devoted to their faith rather than to Thrane); today, the level of cooperation between templars and local authorities varies from place to place. Most people— including those devoted to the Silver Flame—don’t know the actual origins of the Silver Flame; they recognize couatls as divine servants of the Silver Flame, but not as its creators. The faithful believe the Silver Flame is a celestial force strengthened by noble souls, while many Vassals assert the Sovereigns created the Flame.</p><p>The doctrine of the Church of the Silver Flame doesn’t deny the existence of the Sovereigns, and it’s entirely possible—although uncommon—to follow both religions simultaneously. Similarly, most Silver Flame templars are happy to work with paladins of the Host. At the end of the day, the Church of the Silver Flame doesn’t care if the Sovereigns exist. Flamic creed maintains that if they do exist, they are vast powers that maintain their individual domains in the world: Arawai makes sure there’s rain for the crops, while Onatar watches over foundries. That’s all great, but someone has to deal with the ghouls in the graveyard. So the church doesn’t teach anything about the Sovereigns, and it doesn’t encourage its followers to believe in the Sovereigns or incorporate them into its services—but it doesn’t specifically deny the Sovereigns exist or forbid followers from holding both beliefs.</p><p>Along the same lines, the Church of the Silver Flame doesn’t have a unique creation myth; to them, at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter where the world itself came from. Beyond all else, the faith is practical: supernatural evil exists, it threatens the world, and good people should work together to fight it. Compared to our own world, the Church of the Silver Flame is more like the Jedi or the Men in Black than any of our religions. The Silver Flame is a real, concrete source of celestial energy that can empower champions to fight evil. Noble souls strengthen the Flame after death, so be virtuous—and if you want to believe in higher beings beyond that, feel free. What’s important is to protect the innocent from supernatural evil, and faith in the Flame will help you to do that.</p><h2>Secondary Religions</h2><p>Aside from the Silver Flame and the Sovereign Host, most of Khorvaire’s religions are regional. The Blood of Vol is the best known of the secondary religions because of the role it played in Karrnath during the Last War, but outside that nation, most people think it’s some sort of Karrnathi death cult. Everyone knows druids exist, and the Wardens of the Wood are relatively well known because of their central role in the Eldeen Reaches, but other druidic sects are largely unknown outside the areas they operate in. The Path of Light is generally only known about by people who have direct contact with kalashtar communities. Finally, people have a general sense that some elves worship their ancestors, but they don’t know the specific details.</p><h1>Mystical Forces</h1><p>Magic is part of everyday life in the Five Nations. But how deep does this knowledge run? What do people know about the enigmatic fey or the Draconic Prophecy?</p><h2>The Draconic Prophecy</h2><p>Though most people have heard of the “Draconic Prophecy,” they know almost nothing about it aside from the fact that it’s … a prophecy. When common people do talk about the Prophecy, they’re usually thinking of the Caldyn Fragments, a collection of pieces of the Prophecy assembled by Korranberg scholar Ohnal Caldyn (described in City of Stormreach). Most people have no idea that the Prophecy is an evolving matrix of conditional elements, nor that it’s the key to releasing the overlords.</p><h2>Dragons</h2><p>Everyone knows that dragons exist and that they are terrifying and powerful creatures. Stories of dragons guarding hoards of treasure are plentiful, and if you’re from Thrane, you know of the Bane of Thrane, the dragon who slew Prince Thrane. A few stories tell of heroes making bargains with dragons, or of dragons possessing secret knowledge. Everyone knows that Argonnessen is a land of dragons, but they know almost nothing about it beyond “here there be dragons” and the fact that people who go there don’t come back. Some people know that dragons occasionally attack Aerenal, and the giants of Xen’drik were destroyed in some sort of war with dragons.</p><p>So everyone knows dragons exist, they are extremely powerful, and they can be deadly threats or enigmatic advisors—but most people don’t expect to ever see a dragon. The idea of dragons secretly manipulating humanity is a conspiracy theory on par with our world’s idea that many world leaders are secretly reptilian aliens; there are certainly people who believe it, but sensible people don’t take it seriously. </p><h2>Dragonmarks and Aberrant Dragonmarks</h2><p>Dragonmarks have been part of civilization for over a thousand years. The dragonmarked houses provide the major services that are part of everyday life, and everyone in the Five Nations knows the names of the houses and the common twelve marks. However, a character without proficiency in History is unlikely to have heard of the Mark of Death.</p><p>Common knowledge is that aberrant dragonmarks are dangerous to both their bearer and the people around them. Such marks are often seen as the “touch of Khyber.” Without proficiency in History, a character won’t know much about the War of the Mark, aside from the fact that the aberrants were dangerous and destroyed the original city of Sharn.</p><h2>Fey and Archfey</h2><p>Everyone knows that dryads, sprites, and other fey exist, and that they’re especially common near manifest zones tied to Thelanis. Not only do people know fairy tales about fey and archfey, they know these stories have some basis in reality. So when people tell stories about the Lady in Shadow and the Forest Queen, they believe that somewhere in the planes, you might actually be able to meet the Forest Queen and other archfey—though they don’t personally expect to ever meet one. Specific knowledge about the fey is more prevalent in regions close to Thelanian manifest zones or where people have a tradition of bargaining with the fey; notably, Aundairians know more about fey than most other people of the Five Nations.</p><p>Most people can’t easily differentiate between an archfey and some other type of powerful immortal. As a result, cultists of the Dragon Below bargaining with Sul Khatesh might mistakenly think they’re dealing with an archfey, or cultists of Avassh might believe they’re blessed by the Forest Queen. A cult might know they worship a being they call “the Still Lord” or “the Queen of Shadows,” but they don’t automatically know whether that power is a fiend, a fey, or a celestial. Making such distinctions is an academic pursuit that would require a successful ability check.</p><h2>Planes, Moons, and Manifest Zones</h2><p>Everyone knows the names of the planes and their basic attributes: “Shavarath, the Eternal Battleground, is filled with celestials and fiends fighting.” Similarly, they know the names of the moons and that each has a mystic tie to a corresponding plane; many people also hold superstitions regarding the impact of each moon on daily life, especially for those born under that moon. Think of this like knowledge of the solar system in our world; most people can name the planets, and they know Mars is the Red Planet, but only someone who has studied them can tell you the names of each of Jupiter’s moons.</p><p>Even common folk understand the planes have concrete effects on the world through their manifest zones and coterminous/remote phases. Someone may not be able to tell you the precise effects of a Shavarath manifest zone unless they actually live by one, but they know Shavarath is the Eternal Battleground, and they could guess what such a manifest zone might do.</p><h1>Supernatural Evil</h1><p>Fiends, undead, aberrations, and lycanthropes abound in the world—and everyone knows it. They’re aware ghouls may haunt graveyards, the creepy stranger in town could be a vampire or werewolf, and dangerous things could crawl out of Khyber at any time. This is why even people who don’t follow the Silver Flame treat its templars with respect; people understand that evil exists, the Silver Flame opposes it, and the templars are a volunteer militia who are ready to fight it.</p><h2>Demons, Lords of Dust, and Overlords</h2><p>Everyone knows the overlords were archfiends who dominated the world at the beginning of time, are now bound, and would like to break free and destroy the world. You don’t have to worship the Sovereigns or the Flame to believe this; an actual overlord broke out and ravaged Thrane mere centuries ago. Most people have heard stories of a few overlords and may know their titles—the Shadow in the Flame is best known—but a character would need an ability check to know more.</p><p>While everyone knows about the overlords, most have never heard of the Lords of Dust. Most citizens of the Five Nations are familiar with stories of troublesome shapeshifting demons and understand they’re a potential threat, but the idea of a massive fiendish conspiracy manipulating human civilization for thousands of years is as unbelievable as the idea of dragons doing the same thing. Now, if you have credible proof that an individual person in town is actually a fiend or possessed by one, people take the threat seriously, understanding that such threats can be real. But few people actually believe in any massive conspiracy secretly controlling the course of history, because if there were, why haven’t they done anything more dramatic with it?</p><p>Most common folk don’t differentiate between devil, demon, and fiend, instead treating these as synonyms. Rakshasas are widely known as “shapeshifting demons,” even though an arcane scholar might pedantically explicate, “Well, actually, ‘demon’ refers specifically to an incarnate entity of chaos and evil, and the rakshasa is a unique class of fiend most commonly found on the Material Plane.” Similarly, nobody is particularly bothered that the Demon Wastes aren’t called the Fiend Wastes, even if that name would be more accurate.</p><h2>The Dreaming Dark and the Kalashtar</h2><p>Even children know that when you dream, you go to Dal Quor, and “demons give you bad dreams”—but very few people believe the far-fetched idea that those fiends are manipulating the world. People have had bad dreams forever, so if bad-dream demons were going to take over the world, why haven’t they already done it? As with the Lords of Dust, people listen to credible threats that a specific person could be possessed, but few believe stories of a massive dream conspiracy bent on world domination.</p><p>Looking to Sarlona and the Inspired, everyone knows the Riedrans have a strict culture ruled by beings who are said to channel celestial powers. However, in the Five Nations, few people have met even a common Riedran, let alone one of the Inspired. Those who have met kalashtar (usually in a major city) know the kalashtar have been oppressed and driven from Sarlona, but most assume the conflict comes from political and religious differences, not a war between dream-spirits. It’s relatively common knowledge that people from Sarlona study some form of mind-magic, but most people don’t know the precise details of how psionics are different from arcane or divine magic.</p><h2>Khyber and the Daelkyr</h2><p>Tied to the creation myth and to the acceptance that evil exists, people know that bad things come from Khyber. They don’t need to know about demiplanes to understand that if you find a deep hole, there might be something bad at the bottom of it. Most people don’t differentiate between aberrations, fiends, and monstrosities; they just know the Dragon Below is the source of bad things. This is why the cults of the Dragon Below are all lumped together, even though a cult of Dyrrn the Corruptor has nothing in common with a cult of Sul Khatesh. As far as the common folk are concerned, these cults all worship big evil things, and big evil things come from Khyber—thus, they must be a cult of the Dragon Below.</p><p>Anyone who’s proficient in Arcana or Occultism has a general understanding of the difference between the daelkyr and the overlords without needing to make an ability check. But other people aren’t usually familiar with the term “daelkyr” and are likely to conflate any stories about them with the overlords. They’re powerful evil things bound in Khyber that want to break free and destroy the world; what more do you need to know?</p><h1>General Information</h1><p>The Draconic Prophecy, fiends, the Silver Flame—these are dramatic forces in the world. But what about more mundane things? What do the people of the Five Nations actually know about drow, the dar, or even the Aurum?</p><h2>Aerenal, the Undying Court, and the Tairnadal</h2><p>Aerenal is an isolationist culture with little interest in sharing its traditions with others. However, the elves do trade with the Five Nations and there’s been enough immigration over the course of history to provide a general knowledge of their culture. Most people know Aerenal is ruled by the Undying Court, a group of ancient undead elves. However, they don’t fully understand the difference between deathless and other undead.</p><p>Most Five Nations citizens have never heard of the Tairnadal, and they assume any Tairnadal elf is from Valenar. They know Valenar elves are deadly warriors who are always looking for fights and who worship their ancestors, but they don’t know any specifics about patron ancestors or the Keepers of the Past.</p><h2>The Aurum</h2><p>While it’s a stretch to say that everyone’s heard of the Aurum, it’s about as well known as, say, Mensa in our world. The Aurum is generally seen as an exclusive fraternal order of extremely wealthy people. Because it is exclusive and many of its members are minor local celebrities, there are certainly lots of conspiracies theories about what it’s really up to … but despite claims that the Aurum wants to overthrow the Twelve or that it engineered the Last War, at the end of the day, people think of it as that fancy members-only club on Main Street that always donates generously to the Race of Eight Winds celebrations.</p><h2>Uncommon Ancestries</h2><p>People in Khorvaire know lizardfolk and dragonborn come from Q’barra, but most don’t realize these are two different ancestries. Most people know drow are from Xen’drik. Tieflings are generally understood to be planetouched; on the other hand, aasimar and genasi are generally so rare that they won’t be recognized by the general populace. With these and other uncommon folk, Eberron’s people are generally accepting of creatures from ancestries they’ve never encountered. After all, this is a world where people deal with humans, orcs, shifters, goblins, warforged, elves, kalashtar, ogres, medusas, and more every day; so if someone has never seen a goliath before, they’re far more likely to say “Well, that's new” than to panic at the sight of alien giant-folk. Unusual characters are generally targets of curiosity rather than fear.</p><h2>The History of Xen’drik</h2><p>People know Xen’drik was once home to a civilization of giants, who most believe were destroyed in a war with the dragons. Many people know the elves were originally from Xen’drik and fled this destruction. However, without proficiency in an appropriate Lore (like  Xen'drik, Giant, Drow or Elf), most people don’t know the name of any of the giant cultures—nor know there was more than one—and they definitely don’t know anything about giants fighting quori. The idea that arrogant giants destroyed the thirteenth moon is a common folktale, but the legend has many variants and few people consider it truth.</p><h2>Goblins and the Empire of Dhakaan</h2><p>Everyone in the Five Nations knows that a goblin empire inhabited Khorvaire before humanity, but it fell long ago. Most people don’t know the name of this empire or exactly what led to its downfall. People generally recognize Dhakaani ruins as goblin creations, and they know many of Khorvaire’s largest cities are built on goblin foundations. A few fringe groups assert those ancient structures are clearly too sophisticated  to be goblin work and must’ve been built by some forgotten human civilization, but most people consider these stories as the ridiculous conspiracy theories they are—on par with the idea that shapeshifted dragons are secretly manipulating the world.</p><p>Most people of the Five Nations—and even some denizens of Darguun—don’t know the difference between the Kech Dhakaan and the more modern goblin civilizations, like the Marguul and the Ghaal’dar. When someone from the Five Nations meets dar of the Kech Dhakaan, they may recognize that these dar are evoking unusual elements from Dhakaani history. However, it’s not commonly known that the Kech Dhakaan have maintained an unbroken link to the past—nor do Khorvairians have any idea how powerful the goblinoids of Dhakaan are.</p><h2>Shifters and Lycanthropes</h2><p>In the Five Nations, most people believe lycanthropes are cursed humanoids who become animals or hybrids, then prey on innocents, potentially spreading their curse (but are luckily vulnerable to silver). People know most lycanthropes were wiped out in the Silver Crusade (or Lycanthropic Purge), and for the most part, they believe this was a justified action against a serious threat.</p><p>Shifters are often called “weretouched,” and most people believe shifters are distantly connected with lycanthropes. Some even mistakenly believe shifters become aggressive when many moons are full. However, few believe that shifters can spread lycanthropy or that they’re sympathetic to lycanthropes. Those negative stereotypes exist, especially in rural Aundair or places where people have never encountered shifters, but they’re uncommon.</p><h2>Spies</h2><p>When people in the Five Nations talk about spies, they’re usually thinking of the Dark Lanterns or the Royal Eyes of Aundair. These familiar spy agencies are known to operate covertly in other nations, similar to what people in our world knew of the CIA and KGB during the height of the Cold War.</p><p>Most people in the Five Nations have heard of the Trust and understand that it’s some sort of secret police force that maintains order in Zilargo. But they don’t know much beyond that, and people aren’t concerned about Zil spies.</p><p>House Phiarlan and House Thuranni, renowned for their entertainers, aren’t generally viewed as spies. The assertion that Phiarlan runs a spy network is like the idea that Elvis worked for the CIA; not impossible, but also not a particularly credible theory.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Character Creation Overview","type":"text","_id":"yOvFuG4D0h56I3y5","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<img src=\"https://www.tribality.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Eberron-Campaign-Setting-01-750x350.jpg\" width=\"650\" height=\"303\" /><p>This will be a Pathfinder 2E campaign, using the conversion notes that follow in this compendium - both the rules and lore sections.

Eberron then bound Khyber within her own body, forming the world.</li></ul><p>No one knows what came before the world’s creation. In some accounts, Xoriat once encompassed everything; some cults of the Dragon Below assert that the daelkyr are simply trying to restore the original balance of reality. Others contend that there was nothing before creation—that the Progenitors descended from a higher level of reality, the same unknowable realm that lies above and beyond Dolurrh. But almost all cultures agree on the forces that brought reality into existence.</p><p>Three beings wove the planes into existence, then used these concepts as the foundation of the Material Plane. The giants assert that these three beings were some form of titan, but the common interpretation is that of the Progenitor Wyrms: three vast, cosmic dragons. Regardless, the tale ends in conflict. After completing the creation of the Material Plane, Khyber struck without warning and tore Siberys apart, leaving his remnants drifting in the golden Ring of Siberys around the world. </p><p>Knowing she couldn’t defeat Khyber, Eberron coiled around her, becoming the world itself and binding Khyber within a living prison that holds to this day. Thus, the world as we know it is made from the intersection of Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber: the Dragon Above, the Dragon Between, and the Dragon Below. </p><p>While this tale is known to all, some traditions give it more more weight than others. In the Five Nations, most consider it a simple metaphor for sky, earth, and the monsters that lurk below. Even those who consider it literal truth (as do many druids) don’t worship the Progenitors in the same way as they might the Sovereign Host. Siberys is dead, and Eberron is the world itself; she’s the source of all life, but doesn’t actively intervene in any way. However, a few cults (notably among the kobolds of Khorvaire) do worship the Progenitors directly.</p><p>Whether literal truth or metaphor, the battle of these mighty Progenitors took place in the distant past. Its impact upon the present is most importantly this: that there is a present. As this act of creation brought all things into existence, scholars of Khorvaire have yet to find any relics or records of this time before time. If a story involved an object from a deeper past, it would likely possess vast power and be of tremendous scholarly interest.</p><h2>The Age of Demons</h2><p><strong>Period: More than 100,000 years ago</strong><br /><strong>During the Age of Demons, myths tell us...</strong></p><ul><li>Eberron was dominated by the overlords, thirty archfiends who shaped reality to their will.</li><li>Champions, later known as the Sovereign Host, fought the overlords with an alliance of dragons and couatl.</li><li>The sacrifice of the couatl bound the overlords with a force that formed the Silver Flame.</li></ul><p>According to the Progenitor myth, Eberron became the world and all natural creatures are her children. But in the first days of the world, the children of Khyber - fiends, aberrations, and other monsters - rose up from the darkness and claimed dominion over the world. The greatest among these were the overlords, immortal archfiends embodying the evils that plague mortals. Each overlord shaped the world to match their whims, and no civilization could challenge them. It was a time of chaos that lasted for untold millennia.</p><p>The Age of Demons came to an end after an extended war between the overlords and a legendary group of champions - now known as the Sovereign Host. Believed by some to be dragons, by others, gods - or perhaps something else entirely -  these rebels raised an army of dragons allied with the couatl, native celestials said to embody the last light of Siberys. As the immortal overlords couldn’t be destroyed, countless couatl sacrificed themselves, their spirits combining into a prison of pure celestial energy that could bind the overlords. Even today, the overlords remain bound and the world protected from immense evil by this force, now known as the Silver Flame.</p><h3>Why Does It Matter?</h3><p>The Age of Demons ended a hundred thousand years ago, long before the foundation of any civilization that exists today. But the time lingers in myth and continues to shape modern life. It’s commonly believed that the deities of the Sovereign Host walked the world during this time and physically battled the overlords. However, many scholars assert that these myths are actually based on the deeds of heroic dragons - for example, the myths of the Sovereign Aureon might be inspired by the deeds of a dragon named Ourelonastrix.</p><p>While the overlords may have been defeated, they cannot be destroyed. Each overlord is bound in a Khyber dragonshard and held in its prison by the power of the Silver Flame. Though bound, an overlord can influence the world in the region around its prison. Each overlord can only be freed if a particular passage of the Draconic Prophecy comes to pass. The fiends known as the Lords of Dust work to discover and enact these prophecies, while the dragons of the Chamber try to stop them. Both sides frequently use mortals as pawns, so adventurers can easily find themselves caught up in these schemes. Though few mortals are aware of it, this is a constant cold war that determines the fate of the world.</p><h2>The Age of Giants</h2><p><strong>Period: 80,000–40,000 years ago</strong><br /><strong>During the Age of Giants, scholars describe how...</strong></p><ul><li>Giant nations in Xen’drik unlocked secrets of arcane magic still unmatched in the modern age.</li><li>The giants fought the inhabitants of Dal Quor, ending the conflict by destroying a moon and thereby breaking Dal Quor’s link to Eberron.</li><li>The giants threatened to crush an elvish rebellion with dangerous epic magics, prompting the dragons to step in, utterly destroying Xen’drik and cursing the land.</li></ul><p>In the wake of the Age of Demons, the dragons were the most powerful force in Eberron. Some dragons helped guide lesser creatures, including the giants of Xen’drik, in their mastery of arcane magic. As the dragons’ increasing dominion caused a surge in the Daughter of Khyber’s power, the dragons were forced to withdraw to isolation in Argonnessen. They remain there to this day, in hopes of preventing her power from increasing further.</p><p>Multiple nations of giants arose on Xen’drik. The Sulat League specialized in elemental binding and magebreeding. They created the drow as living weapons to deal with rebellious elves, and it’s thought that fire giants are remnants of the Sulat. The Group of Eleven was an alliance of eleven city-states, each led by a powerful empyrean mage. Their diverse culture valued internal and external competition, believing it drove evolution. The Cul’sir Dominion was ruled by mighty empyreans and sought to dominate all reality. They explored the planes as well as the world; it’s not known whether the Cul’sir attacked Dal Quor or whether the quori of the time sought to invade Eberron, but the two powers fought an extended war. The giants ended the conflict by destroying one of the moons of Eberron with cataclysmic magic, damaging the planar connection between Dal Quor and the world. Since then, the quori have been unable to physically travel to Eberron, and there are no longer any manifest zones to Dal Quor.</p><p>These actions had devastating repercussions for giant civilization. In the upheaval, many Cul’sir subjects used the opportunity to rebel, but the largest uprising was that of theelves - both those oppressed by the Cul’sir, and warrior elves who had never been conquered by the giants. When the Cul’sir threatened to draw on their most dangerous magics once more to destroy the elves, the dragons emerged in force from Argonnessen. They utterly devastated the civilizations of Xen’drik, giant and otherwise, then laid curses on the land that are beyond the comprehension of the modern age. To this day, the scourge of the land prevents any advanced civilization from rising again. The Traveler’s Curse warps space and makes travel in Xen’drik unreliable. The curse known as the Du’rashka Tul - “the madness of crowds” - causes civilizations that become too advanced or widespread to collapse into madness. Draconic curses are believed the reason the giants devolved from mighty titans into hill giants and the other giants known today. The full extent of these draconic curses is unknown, but the impact is unmistakable.</p><h3>Why Does It Matter?</h3><p>The curses laid on Xen’drik mean that the entire continent is in essence a vast dungeon, a land that can never be fully mapped or explored. The giants mastered secrets of arcane magic as yet unmatched by humanity or even by the elves, and as such Xen’drik is a source for powerful artifacts, spells, and eldritch machines. Elemental airships and the development of the warforged were both inspired by discoveries tied to the ancient giants.</p><p>While Xen’drik’s many curses make it nearly impossible to colonize the land, that doesn’t stop people from trying! The city of Stormreach is an outpost on the edge of the unknown, a gateway through which powerful artifacts, unknown magics, and exotic creatures flow into Khorvaire. Beyond Stormreach lies an intriguing continent of ruins and wonders, waiting to be explored.</p><h2>The Age of Monsters</h2><p><strong>Period: 40,000–5,000 years ago</strong><br /><strong>During the Age of Monsters, history recounts that...</strong></p><ul><li>Elf refugees fleeing the devastation of Xen’drik settled in Aerenal, birthing the Undying Court, the Aereni, and the Tairnadal.</li><li>Goblins and orcs dominated Khorvaire, while dwarves, dragonborn, gnomes, and halflings had a smaller presence and impact on the continent.</li><li>The goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan flourished for ten thousand years, then was destroyed when the daelkyr invaded the Material Plane. Though the daelkyr were defeated, their seeds of madness destroyed the goblinoid civilization.</li><li>The daelkyr conflict destroyed the dwarven Realm Below.</li></ul><p>After Xen’drik was shattered by the dragons, they remained isolated in Argonnessen. Human civilization was slowly taking shape on Sarlona, but the most dynamic cultures of this period were forming on and around the continent of Khorvaire. The elves founded a new homeland on Aerenal -  “Aeren’s rest” in Elvish - instituting the Undying Court and establishing the cultures that would become the Aereni and the Tairnadal. On Khorvaire, the goblinoids rose to prominence, founding the Empire of Dhakaan approximately 16,000 years ago. Over the course of the next ten thousand years, it expanded to dominate all of central Khorvaire. The Dhakaani slowly drove all of their competitors to the fringes - the mountains, the wastes, the marches. They clashed with the dragonborn of what’s now Q’barra, the dwarves of the Realm Below, and Tairnadal explorers, but none could stop the advance of Dhakaan.</p><p>However, when the daelkyr led armies of aberrations through portals from Xoriat, the Empire of Dhakaan was shattered - along with the Realm Below, the vast subterranean civilization of the dwarves.</p><p>Though this bitter conflict came to an end when Dhakaani champions and Gatekeeper druids sealed the daelkyr in Khyber, the damage inflicted was irreparable. In addition to creating monsters such as dolgaunts and doppelgangers, the daelkyr unleashed more subtle curses and strains of madness. One of these eroded the connection to the goblinoids’ shared dream that united Dhakaani civilization. Within generations, the ancient empire collapsed into civil war. Cults and cruelty spread among the goblinoids, and soon, all that remained on the surface of Khorvaire were ruins and chaos.</p><h3>Why Does It Matter?</h3><p>Dhakaani ruins are scattered across Khorvaire. Most major cities of the modern age are built on Dhakaani foundations, and there are tunnels and warrens beneath them that have been largely ignored by the human inhabitants. While the Empire wasn’t as advanced as the civilizations of giants that came before, the daashor artificers of Dhakaan produced remarkable artifacts and were master weaponsmiths with a remarkable understanding of adamantine and other exotic alloys.</p><p>This is the story that underlies both the rise of Darguun and the recent emergence of the Heirs of Dhakaan. Before the arrival of humanity, goblins and orcs shaped the destiny of the continent, and there are many who yearn to reclaim that ancient glory.</p><p>Though it occurred thousands of years ago, the impact of the daelkyr incursion is still felt across Khorvaire. The cults of the Dragon Below and the Gatekeeper druids are active legacies of this conflict. The Mror dwarves are venturing into the ruined Realm Below and recovering daelkyr symbionts and other relics. While the daelkyr remain sealed - and scheming - in Khyber, someone could stumble upon ancient fortifications, an organic daelkyr vault, or some other remnant of this forgotten war.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Recent History","type":"text","_id":"r8BYlHWRw5kORkYz","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p style=\"width:643.891px\">Scholars at Morgrave University call the last five thousand years the Age of Humanity, contending that its defining trait is the rise of human civilization and its spread from Sarlona to Khorvaire.

The Last War came to an end after Cyre was destroyed in a cataclysm known as the Mourning. The Five Nations remain divided today, sharing Khorvaire with the new nations established by the Treaty of Thronehold. The remaining Five Nations remain the largest and most powerful countries in Khorvaire.</p></blockquote><p>The roots of the Last War run far back into the history of the Galifar kingdom, if not to the founding of the Five Nations themselves. The very fact that the united kingdom continued to be referred to as the Five Nations points to the sense of national pride that persisted even after King Galifar I’s successful military campaign to forge a unifi ed realm.</p><p>King Jarot, the last king of Galifar, accomplished many great things during his reign. Wonders such as the warforged and the floating fortresses of Breland appeared, and the lightning rail expanded throughout central Khorvaire during this period. But Jarot was plagued by dark and disturbing dreams and visions that also led to the largest military buildup in the history of the kingdom. Few outside his closest circle understood the depths of Jarot’s fears. He saw doom coming to his beloved kingdom with every sunrise, and disaster edging closer every time the dark of night spread across the land.</p><p>These secret and not-so-secret preparations increased tensions throughout the Five Nations. Soon, everyone was seeing threats and dangers in every shadow, and in this environment of growing fear, national ties became stronger than those binding the kingdom together. With great armies at their command, the governor-princes were more than a little drunk with power when the spark that ignited the war occurred.</p><p>That spark was the unexpected death of King Jarot. The Last War began in earnest when three of Jarot’s children—Thalin of Thrane, Kaius of Karrnath, and Wroann of Breland—rejected their eldest sibling Mishann’s rightful claim to the throne. Initially, Thalin and Kaius wanted to explore options other than the accident of order of birth to determine the best one of them to ascend the throne. Wroann, however, knew who was best suited to rule. She believed that her love of freedom demanded that she take the crown and then use the power of the throne to reshape Galifar into a more progressive and libertyinfused country. Mishann wasn’t about to relinquish her claim, and soon each governor-prince decided that the crown would best fit on his or her own head.</p><p>Once begun, the Last War endured for a hundred years. Of course, times of relative calm reigned during that century of warfare. At times, battles raged in parts of Khorvaire while peace (or at least truce) held sway in others. What began as a battle between two relatively unifi ed alliances—Cyre and Aundair on one side, and Breland, Karrnath, and Thrane on the other—quickly dissolved into a general melee. Alliances were forged and broken countless times during the course of the war. Before the war had ended, the Kingdom of Galifar and each of its constituent nations, at least one dragonmarked house, and ordinary families everywhere were sundered and turned against each other.</p><p>The Last War wrought inestimable harm to portions of Khorvaire, but from some perspectives it also brought change for the better. Eight recognized nations gained their independence over the course of the conflict. From war, a new race was born. Magical technology, originally developed for military use, now makes life in peacetime more comfortable, with the airship being the most recent such innovation. Just as the ancient and legendary war between dragons and fiends is thought by some to have paved the way for the new glory of the giant empires, so many believe that the tragedy of the Last War created the potential for a new golden age of civilization to emerge across Khorvaire.</p><p>While peace currently reigns, all of the problems and grievances that came to the forefront during the Last War remain. Old wounds and lingering resentments, ongoing struggles and desperate competition, secret deals and double-crosses—these factors and more leave the threat of another great war looming on the horizon. Some believe it is only a matter of time before such a conflict erupts across the land.</p><h3>The Day of Mourning</h3><p>What happened on 20 Olarune, 994 YK? No one can say for certain—at least no one who survived that day. Some catastrophe, certainly magical in nature, swept through the lands of Cyre, and nothing was left alive. </p><p>Though not all its territories were lost, Cyre ceased to exist as a nation on that day. The lands that were not destroyed were incorporated into Darguun, Valenar, and the Talenta Plains. The rest became the Mournland. </p><p>The war did not cease on the Day of Mourning, however. Cyran forces in Breland and Karrnath surrendered almost immediately, but battles continued to rage in Thrane, Aundair, and Breland for at least another year. In fact, the war intensified, with no side knowing what had happened and all fearing that another such catastrophe might be unleashed if decisive victory was not quickly achieved.</p><p>There are as many theories about the nature of the Day of Mourning as there are people who think about it. Many blame House Cannith, believing that some arcane experiments taking place within its forgeholds caused the catastrophe. Some say that a secretive cabal of Cyran wizards called on the same forces that the giants had used to stop the quori invasion forty thousand years before, accidentally unleashing those forces on their own nation. Still others accuse Cyre’s enemies of unleashing those same forces, but intentionally. Some believe that the Day of Mourning was a natural catastrophe, while others hold that its origin was divine—either a deadly warning or a horrifi c punishment from the gods.</p><p>A few people point to the Day of Mourning as evidence that events long prophesied have begun to take place, signaling the eventual destruction of the whole world in a similar manner. Some of these prophets of doom gather into small communities on the borders of the Mournland, living lives of pious devotion in the hopes of being spared from the coming devastation. Others abandon themselves to lives of hedonistic luxury, making merry before their lives hasten to an end. Still others look for ways to manipulate the uncertainty in the Day of Mourning’s aftermath to achieve their own mysterious goals.</p><h3>Thronehold</h3><p>Despite the escalation of hostilities after the destruction of Cyre, it was clear that the participants in the Last War had become willing to fi nd a way to end a century of hostilities. Even before the Day of Mourning, King Kaius III began searching for a place that could be considered neutral ground to host the peace talks. He fi nally settled on Thronehold, the castle from which the kings and queens of Galifar had ruled. Perched on an island in the middle of Scions Sound, it was a prize coveted by all the combatants but which none had been able to claim.</p><p>During all the years of the Last War, Thronehold was guarded and maintained by an elite group of warriors from House Deneith known as the Throne Wardens. They acknowledged no legitimate heir to the throne, and protected the castle and all its belongings from usurpers.</p><p>The peace talks included the leaders of the original Five Nations plus representatives from Darguun, Zilargo, the Mror Holds, the Eldeen Reaches, Q’barra, Valenar, the Lhazaar Principalities, and even a halfling empowered to speak for all the tribes of the Talenta Plains. Other groups petitioned to be included in the Thronehold Accords, but were refused. The deliberations merely to settle the question of who would participate occupied the initial period of the conferences. The groups that were not granted recognition and the right to participate included a delegation from Droaam as well as representatives from a number of ethnic or religious minorities who hoped to carve their own sliver of land out of the wreckage of postwar Khorvaire.</p><p>Each group that did participate in the treaty process had its own agenda and demands. At fi rst, some refused to even sit across from each other, but the desire for peace soon overcame mutual distrust.</p><p>Over the course of several weeks, this group hammered out the accords that defi ned the borders as they are seen on current maps. Sovereignty was granted to several groups, nominal independence to others, and a binding peace agreement was signed by all.</p><p>Two other items of business, aside from the overarching question of national boundaries and reparations, occupied the delegates to Thronehold. The first was a philosophical dilemma with profound implications for society. The chronicles ran articles for months about “the warforged question,” and how the nations would treat this new race that had come to exist as a direct result of the war. Never before had a political body spent so much time in the consideration of such metaphysical questions. (It should be noted that no warforged was allowed to participate in any of these discussions.) In the end, the new race was given a twoedged sword. On one hand, House Cannith was ordered to halt production of warforged and dismantle its creation forges. On the other, all existing warforged were granted the full rights of citizenship in the nations of Khorvaire, rather than being deemed objects to be possessed by other citizens. (Interestingly, the delegates also neglected to address the question of whether elementals that had been bound to service should receive the same rights.)</p><p>As a final accord, and at the insistence of the Throne Wardens, the thriving city of Throneport was declared neutral ground, accessible to all nations but belonging to none. The castle and its grounds, on the other hand, remain off limits and under the protection of the Throne Wardens.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":800000,"name":"Languages of Eberron","type":"text","_id":"TxglTqMUH87c764O","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>The following languages are present in the world of Eberron.

What the it won't tell you is how to make your character feel like he or she belongs in the world of Eberron. That’s what this section does. It outlines a dozen character types - basic personality and background packages that can help you make a character who feels like a coherent part of the setting. Some of these types are fairly generic: Any setting could feature outlanders, for example, or restless wanderers. Others are quite specific to Eberron, including chroniclers and inquisitives.</p><p style=\"padding:0px;width:643.891px;margin:var(--p-space,1em) auto 0px auto\">Most types work just fine for characters of any ancestry, heritage or class. These types can also be used to help narrow down the background you'd like to take as well. An outlander, for example, could be a halfling barbarian from the Talenta Plains or a half-orc oracle from the Shadow Marches. Not every combination of ancestry, heritage, class, region of origin, and type will make sense to you, though. Try to find a combination that appeals to you and work from there.</p><p style=\"padding:0px;width:643.891px;margin:var(--p-space,1em) auto 0px auto\">There is no game-mechanical benefit to choosing a character type. Rather, each type consists solely of suggestions for developing the background, personality, and mannerisms of your character.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Chronicler","type":"text","_id":"VAWtQ0aagoTsDVLl","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>“What a story!”</p><p> —Kalva Dannor, gnome bard</p></blockquote><p>When you can sell a story to a publication such as the Korranberg Chronicle or the Sharn Inquisitive, everything that happens around you starts to look like a story that needs to be written. You seek out adventure wherever you can find it—but you sometimes act more like an observer than a participant.</p><h3>Adventuring</h3><p>You grew up reading about the Last War in the pages of the Korranberg Chronicle, and thought that it sounded exciting. You imagined yourself huddled in a tent near the front lines, scrawling a dispatch that you would send back to Korranberg to be read across the Five Nations. Of course, once you finally got a job writing for a small local chronicle, you spent more time talking to farmers about their crops than you did doing anything remotely resembling adventuring. Now you’ve made it: You travel with a group of adventurers, write about your experiences, and sell the stories to any chronicle that buys them. At least, sometimes you sell the stories.</p><p>The primary criterion by which you judge whether to undertake an adventure is whether or not you think it will make a good story. By “good story,” you might mean one that’s dramatic and exciting, or you might mean one that will sell. Other factors are less important: Will your participation make a difference in the world? Are innocent lives at stake? Does the adventure itself pay well? It doesn’t matter—as long as it makes a good story.</p><p>If nothing else, an adventure could at least get you close to a big story that’s otherwise unrelated to the adventure itself. If someone wants to hire a group of bodyguards for an airship journey, you might not show any interest at all - until you learn that an important noble or famous diplomat will be on the same airship, on a mysterious mission. Now that’s a good story!</p><h3>Personality</h3><p>Young chroniclers approach their task with exuberant enthusiasm, excited at the prospect of turning their experiences into gripping tales that will thrill a new generation of readers. Is that you, or has your attitude devolved into a bitter cynicism? It’s easy to fall into the jaded view that chronicling is a pretty word for lying, trying to make the horrors of war or the terrors of the world sound exciting. But hey, excitement sells stories, so you’ll make the story as lurid as possible to make the sale.</p><h3>Behavior</h3><p>Take notes about everything your companions do. You might even be tempted to hang back out of combat for a moment or two while you finish scribbling your notes about the events that led to the combat. (Don’t take this to the point where your allies become angry at your inaction. Finish jotting down notes instead of moving in between spells or other helpful actions.) Most important, act as though you were a character in an exciting story that will be told around the world—be dramatic, be dynamic, take risks, and live large. </p><h3>Language</h3><p>Words are your livelihood, so talk a lot. Describe your own actions as if you were writing them for a popular audience. You might refer to yourself in the third person, either by name or as “your intrepid chronicler” or “your humble scribe.” Describe the actions of your companions and your enemies in the same way. When your companions do something dramatic or memorable, narrate what happened, even as you continue fi ghting.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Devotee of the Host","type":"text","_id":"jR8hEHTmrjpBW3zm","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote style=\"padding-left:var(--space-2xl);width:643.891px\"><p>“Sovereigns preserve us.”</p><p> —Kuduth, half-elf cleric</p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px\">Even if you’re not a cleric, the deities of the Sovereign Host are important to you. You were brought up to show them proper reverence, and devotion to the ideals they represent guides your every step.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Adventuring</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">You have been profoundly influenced by a particular cycle of myths relating to the Sovereign Host and the Dark Six—myths that are no longer widely told, but that have inspired countless generations of heroes to take up arms against the forces of evil in the world. These myths are collectively called the Rebellion Saga, and they speak of tthe original and ongoing rebellion of the Dark Six against the rule of the Sovereigns. According to these ancient tales, it is the work of the devout to bring the Dark Six back into the fold, which will be accomplished by quelling their rebellious followers.</p><p style=\"width:643.891px\">Naturally, reuniting the Dark Six with the rest of the pantheon is not likely to happen any time soon, although certain apocalyptic groups believe in its inevitability. Thus, for most adventuring devotees, quelling the rebellion by slaying monsters, imprisoning necromancers, and proselytizing changelings is little more than a good long-term justification for actions that also make sense in the short term, by making the world safer for the civilized races of Khorvaire.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Personality</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">Your devotion to the Host shines through everything you do—at least, you hope it does. When you enter battle, you try to reflect the strength of Dol Dorn and the honor of Dol Arrah. You offer prayers to Olladra, Arawai, and Balinor before eating, to Onatar before using your crafting skills, and to Aureon every time you cast a spell. You protect families and villages in imitation of Boldrei, and you guard caravans and merchants for Kol Korran’s sake</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Behavior</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">Your devotion is your defining characteristic, but it describes little about your personality. You are not necessarily a prude, a pacifist, or a philanthropist, though you might be any of those things. You try to wrap everything you do in a shroud of religious devotion. You probably don’t do it consciously to try to impress others; rather, you do it because that’s how you’ve learned to do things. You might feel that everything you make should be dedicated to Onatar, but the prayers you recite out of habit while crafting are only the outward expression of that intrinsic belief</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Language</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">Prayers, oaths, and invocations pepper your speech. Generic invocations of the Sovereigns serve many purposes, such as “Sovereigns preserve us!” or simply “Sovereigns!” used as an expression of surprise or frustration. Curses often use the names of the Dark Six: “Aureon’s Shadow!” or “Keeper take you!” are common ones. Feel free to improvise short prayers to Dol Dorn for wading into battle, to Olladra before eating, and so on</p><h3 style=\"width:643.891px\">Variants</h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">You might be devoted to a particular deity of the Sovereign Host rather than the entire pantheon, or you might worship the Silver Flame. If you follow the Path of Light or revere the Undying Court, your specific motivations and oaths will vary, but your basic personality would be similar.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"House Renegade","type":"text","_id":"7k9Ga3tnOXJwK8Yi","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote style=\"padding-left:var(--space-2xl);width:643.891px\"><p>\"I prefer not to use my family name, thank you.”</p><p> —Gaven, half-elf ranger</p></blockquote><p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px\">Sometimes being a member of a dragonmarked house means power, prestige, and infl uence. Sometimes it means living firmly under the thumb of a controlling relative until you can find a way to escape. Congratulations—you’ve found a way.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Adventuring</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">You adventure because it’s better than the alternative, a tightly controlled life as part of a dragonmarked house. Your family thinks you should be home, putting your talents to use in the service of your house. Your mother wants you where she can keep an eye on you and make sure you don’t get into any trouble. Your father wants to find you someone appropriate to marry and keep your children close at hand.</p><p style=\"width:643.891px\"> Fundamentally, you adventure because you know your family hates it. You might not know yet what you want to do with your life—adventuring might just be something you’re doing to kill time until you fi gure it out—but you know it won’t involve the work of your house.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Personality</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">Clearly, you’ve got a rebellious streak. You don’t necessarily reject all authority, but you certainly don’t like to be under anyone’s thumb. You can be sardonic, cynical, and harsh sometimes, especially when the people around you start sounding like they think they own you. But you’re not bad at heart. Is it so wrong to want to shape your own destiny?</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Behavior</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">Even though you’ve probably been disowned, you’re used to a life of relative luxury, and your habits and mannerisms refl ect that. You prefer to stay in upper-class hotels rather than common inns, and to feast in a private dining room rather than squeeze in to a spot at the board to get your share of stew with the peasants. That said, you have a lot more respect for the working classes than most people of your station, and you’re not inclined to boss people around or expect doting service. These people have aspirations and dreams of their own—you can’t follow yours without encouraging them to follow theirs.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Language</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">You were brought up well, and your manner of speaking refl ects that. You have an educated vocabulary and a solid grasp of correct grammar. You avoid slang and vulgar language, unless you intend to shock or provoke. Of course, house renegades live to shock and provoke, especially when they know that others have preconceived notions of how they ought to behave and want to shake up those opinions.</p><h3 style=\"width:643.891px\">Variants</h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">You might be a younger child of a noble family rather than a dragonmarked house, or even a former rising star in a church hierarchy fl eeing from the controlling infl uence of a religious mentor. In addition, your reasons for fleeing your family might vary: Perhaps you committed a crime, or a change in power in your house left you out of favor.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"House Scion","type":"text","_id":"aIhFrbF0zYBh82sE","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote style=\"padding-left:var(--space-2xl);width:643.891px\"><p>“Yes, father, I realize this reflects poorly on our house.

You are a member of one of those houses, and though power comes with any number of responsibilities, you welcome your familial duties as a reasonable price to pay for the social, political, economic, and magical power to which you are heir.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Adventuring</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\"> Adventuring has to fit in with the duties that come to you by virtue of your house membership. With luck, the two coincide perfectly: You undertake adventures at the behest of the head of your house or some other prominent figure (perhaps a parent), performing missions that advance the aims of the house or simply bring treasures into its coffers. When you’re not so lucky, you still need to bear your house’s interests in mind—looking for opportunities to advance your own house or deal a setback to a competing one. Any secrets you unearth or treasures you claim can benefi t your house, and anything that hurts another house helps yours.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Personality</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">You were born to power and have come to view it as your birthright. You can be imperious, arrogant, and spoiled at times, and at the best of times you are smugly superior. You can also be calculating,  dispassionate, and even amoral, depending on your alignment—the demands of your house sometimes do not coincide with the expectations of traditional morality. You are comfortable in rigid, well-defined structures of authority, as long as you know your place in them.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Behavior</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">You are used to a life of comfort, and take pains to keep up to that standard while adventuring, perhaps even to the point of using Leomund’s secure shelter while traveling through the jungle so that you can rest comfortably at night. Depending on who your adventuring companions are, you might see their company as a necessary evil for the work you must do, preferring the company of others while you are in cities between adventures. You might even spend the evenings, while your companions are sharing tales around the campfi re, writing letters to your true friends and dear family members back home.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Language</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">You were brought up well, and your manner of speaking reflects it.

But ever since the day when the Emerald Claw agents burst into your home looking for you, or you woke up and found yourself in a strange forest with a dragon saying you were part of the Prophecy, or you manifested magical powers you never knew you had—ever since then, this lightning-rail ride of a life has been moving so quickly that you don’t know how to jump off and get things back to normal.</p><p style=\"width:643.891px\">Maybe there is something special about you.

For whatever reason, other people are far more interested in your life than you yourself used to be. You’ve managed to keep one step ahead of them so far—or maybe you haven’t, and “they” are your adventuring companions.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Personality</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">You are somewhat bewildered about all the events that have brought you to this point in your life. You don’t understand why people are so interested in you, and you often wish they’d just leave you alone. You’d rather not go through all these harrowing adventures, but some greater force in the world seems to have decreed that adventuring is your lot in life, so you’ve had to figure out how to make the best of it.</p><p style=\"width:643.891px\"> Take care not to degenerate into constant whining and complaining, or your companions will quickly tire of both it and you. You’ve been thrust into the spotlight against your will; if you speak softly and try to deflect that attention, maybe things will quiet down soon. Also, don’t assume that every adventure should be about you and the people who are after you. Don’t ever believe that you are as important as people seem to think you are.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Behavior</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">Cling to the illusion of being an ordinary person yanked unwillingly into a life of adventure for as long as possible.

Rely on your adventuring companions for some degree of protection, while looking for ways to contribute materially to any situation without intentionally meaning to.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Language</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">You are soft-spoken and unassuming.

And those agents of the Chamber, they couldn’t possibly be looking for you.</p><h3 style=\"width:643.891px\">Variants</h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">You might suffer from amnesia, and your adventuring career is an attempt to recover the knowledge and abilities you have lost.

You probe murders, find missing people, stop blackmailers, and break up smuggling rings. Your  investigations are not necessarily limited to such mundane problems: You might unmask a rakshasa posing as a city councilor, find the possessed ancient mask that forced the professor to commit all those grisly murders, or dispel the magic keeping the house scion’s son in his comatose slumber.</p><p style=\"width:643.891px\"> This archetype is best suited for a campaign with a limited geographical scope, whether it takes place in a single metropolis (such as Sharn) or hops from city to city.

You’re so used to corruption and crime that you don’t expect to meet honest people, and you’re surprised at acts of selflessness and sacrifice. “Jaded” doesn’t begin to describe how cynical and bitter you can be in your worst moments. You’ve been cheated so many times that you always ask for money up front. You’ve seen so much hatred and death that nothing shocks you at this point—or at least that’s the image you project.  Deep inside, there might be a part of you that still mourns over every corpse you find sprawled in an alley, still grieves for the lost soul of humanity and its kin, and still believes there might be some hope and goodness left in the world. But you know full well that if anyone sees that tiny part of you, they’ll exploit it—or at least mock it mercilessly.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Behavior</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">Cultivate behavior that conveys just how tough you are. Sharpen your sword or fiddle with a dagger during down time. Never open a door when you can kick it in. You might be able to talk your way out of tricky situations, but you should also be prepared to fight your way out: The kinds of people you deal with usually prefer to fight.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Language</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\"> The wisecrack is like an off-hand weapon for you.

You might be on a quest to find some item or piece of knowledge of signifi cance to your people—a relic that can cure the plague ravaging your clan, a tome that will reveal the nature of the demon that hunts them, or an artifact that explains your people’s history or some aspect of iit. Alternatively, you might be seeking to prove yourself—to exonerate yourself of a crime, to win the hand of the chieftain, or simply to secure your position as an adult in your community. Or you might have been banished from your clan for a crime you actually did commit, and are forever unable to return.</p><p style=\"width:643.891px\"> You might eventually grow so accustomed to life among more civilized people that you don’t want to return, or become restless and uneasy among your own people when you see them again.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Personality</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">Your attitude toward civilization is your defining characteristic. Decide how you view the civilized society around you as well as your sophisticated allies, and try to see everything around you through that lens. Do you maintain a superior contempt for their soft and weak ways, or do you find those ways alluring? Do you wander wideeyed through the magnificent towers of Sharn, marveling at the achievements of magic and technology, or do you feel trapped any time you’re forced to remain indoors?</p><p style=\"width:643.891px\"> When you return to lands that are more comfortable and familiar to you, change your behavior drastically—take on more of a leadership role, or revert to a role like the one you have in your homeland, whatever that role might be.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Behavior</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">Most outlanders make some effort to practice the traditions and rituals of their homeland no matter how far they travel. You might do this simply out of habit, even if you repudiate the beliefs and mores of your people. These minor rituals might include hanging charms around a sleeping place, pouring out wine to the cardinal directions before drinking, taking souvenir body parts from slain foes, or invoking the names of patron spirits or totems at frequent intervals.</p><h3 style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px;font-family:var(--sans-serif)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">Language</span></h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\"> Even if you are not entirely comfortable speaking Common, you are just as capable as anyone of expressing complex thoughts and sophisticated ideas in your own language. Scatter phrases of your native language into your speech.

Avoid accents unless you can pull one off without sounding goofy.</p><h3 style=\"width:643.891px\">Variants</h3><p style=\"width:643.891px\">Warforged can be similar to outlanders in that human society can seem strange and alien to them, but they have nothing to compare it to, except perhaps a life in the military during the Last War.

If you seek out adventure, it’s because a place sounds interesting, not because there’s anything in particular you want to accomplish there. You are eager to visit new places, try new modes of transportation, see creatures you’ve never seen before, and (at least to some extent) do things you’ve never done.

Some experience of the world beyond your village might have sparked your wanderlust: Perhaps a traveling troupe of actors or musicians came through, or a party of adventurers stayed in the village for a couple of weeks while exploring nearby ruins. That experience gave substance to your dreams of a different life—you might even have followed the travelers out of town, launching your life of wandering in a dramatic way. You still retain some of that youthful, wide-eyed dreaminess and a sense that the world is full of wonders just waiting to be explored. You are not necessarily naive about life’s harsh realities, but you retain a sense of wonder that no amount of bitter experience has yet been able to quash.</p><p style=\"width:643.891px\">You might have a particular interest that gives a focus to your wandering.

You might be hesitant to use anything or go anywhere until you have properly researched it, or you might rush in to do your research on-site. Look for opportunities to use your various areas of knowledge.

(Though you’re more than willing to try.)  The driving force in your adventuring life is, whether you admit it or not, a burning desire to escape the circumstances you grew up in. You want to make a life for yourself that’s better than the poverty and crime that defined your youth. you want money, certainly, but more than that you want respect, dignity, a sense of meaning and purpose, and a shred of hope. You definitely do not want to die, alone and friendless, and be left to rot in an abandoned sewer tunnel. In your adventuring career, that’s one risk you would just as soon not take.

You have a sense of ethics and honor, primarily focused on the idea that you don’t turn on your friends. But actions that might make a paladin of the Silver Flame cringe are just the way things get done to your mind—actions such as paying bribes, fencing valuable goods, or stealing magic tomes from your enemies.

Also note, that the term \"wizard's circle is a bit a misnomer - while wizards certainly comprise the vast majority of the membership within each circle, anyone who can cast spells from the arcane tradition is generally welcomed, primarily certain sorcerers and witches.

You don’t gain new synergistic spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new synergistic spells and new spell levels of synergistic spells only through feats. Synergistic spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your arcane class; for example, a wizard who gained synergistic spells would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire.</p><p>Each time you cast a synergistic spell, it is an arcane spell. You can’t heighten a synergistic spell beyond your maximum spell level of synergistic spell, even if you have higher-level spell slots, and you can’t select a synergistic spell as a signature spell.</p><p>Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, and each time you gain a synergistic feat, you can swap out one of your old synergistic spells for a different synergistic spell of the same level; this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as via a sorcerer’s spell repertoire class feature. You can also swap out synergistic spells by retraining during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a synergistic spell, you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely.</p><h2>Arcane Circle Insignia</h2><p>When a wizard circle admits an individual as a member, they are granted the right to wear the insignia of the order. These typically take the form of broaches, pendants or rings, or perhaps the ornated topper to a staff or rod, depending on the circle. By broad tradition on Khorvaire, these insignia may be personalized relatively expansively by the individual member, with each member's personalized insignia also becoming an abstract representation of the outward magic that the member chooses to focus on, the internal magic that is an intrinsic part of the member, and the member’s true spiritual essance. These insignia almost always incorporate the form of an animal specific to the order.</p><h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.DBxaqSNA6DjlA7pS]{Arcane Synergist Dedication} Feat 2</h2><div><p>Prerequisites A member of a Wizard's Circle in Eberron, trained in Arcana, your primary class must cast spells from the Arcane tradition</p></div><div><div><div><hr /></div><div><p>You devote much of your study to synergistic magic.

{"name":"4 - The Dragonmarked Houses","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"Overview","type":"text","_id":"iagwQJjg9cSQxOmE","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>Magic is the lifeblood of Eberron, encircling it like the Ring of Siberys and seeping up through the earth from the bones of Khyber. Perhaps the clearest manifestation of this pervasive magic is the appearance of dragonmarks among seven of Khorvaire’s common races. Dragonmarks are elaborate skin patterns—more intricate and colorful than birthmarks, more distinctive than any tattoo—that also grant their bearers innate spell-like abilities. There are twelve families of dragonmarks, each one associated with a number of closely related manifestations.</p></blockquote><p>The dragonmarked houses have existed for thousands of years. For some reason not completely understood, the common races living on the continents of Khorvaire and Aerenal developed dragonmarks and the spell-like abilities associated with them. Some sages believe that the abundance of Eberron dragonshards on these continents has something to do with the development of dragonmarks, but no one can prove this theory. What is known is that humans and elves never manifested dragonmarks while living in the Eberron-dragonshard-deficient regions of Sarlona and Xen’drik.</p><p>Individual dragonmarks appeared within bloodlines, and soon family dynasties sprang up to take advantage of the dragonmark powers. Each family created an economic empire using the dragonmarks, and the dragonmarked houses developed into independent commerce states operating across multiple nations. The War of the Mark, which ended about fifteen hundred years ago, stabilized the houses and ended the threat of aberrant and mixed marks that might have destroyed the economy of Khorvaire. Today, twelve dragonmarks shared among thirteen houses form the basis for economic power across the continent.</p><p>Agreements reached at the end of the War of the Mark formalized tenets and traditions that all the houses adhere to. These include rules concerning neutrality (all houses make a show of remaining neutral so that they can operate in all nations), fair trade and practices, family naming conventions, and a ban on marriages between houses so that the dragonmarks remain pure. </p><p>Family members run each house, with either a matriarch or patriarch serving as the chief executive of both family and economic business. House family members form an economic aristocracy on par with the royal and noble families of the various nations, and family leaders are literally barons of industry and commerce. Each house also employs retainers and hirelings to aid in the family business. Those retainers and hirelings who show initiative and promise can rise through the ranks to hold important positions within the house. The most effective and promising of these might be invited into the family through marriage to the young scions of the blood, thus making sure the bloodline continues.</p><p>Even though the house blood flows through the veins of every family member, not every one of them has a dragonmark; only a small percentage of every generation manifests a mark. Among those who do, the least mark is the most common to appear, with fewer lesser marks, and fewer still greater marks appearing in each generation. Those who do develop a dragonmark are singled out for great things and have responsibilities to the family that scions without marks never have to worry about<span style=\"font-family:var(--journal-serif)\">.</span></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Dragonmarks","type":"text","_id":"96MkI8aj7raX3Y2c","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>A dragonmark is a magical symbol that manifests on the skin, but its color immediately differentiates it from any mundane tattoo. A dragonmark is etched in shades of blue, green, and purple so vivid that they appear to glow, though the mark provides no real illumination.</p></blockquote><p>A dragonmark is associated with one or more magical abilities, and a person who carries a dragonmark can exercise these powers. When a bearer invokes the power of a dragonmark, its colors shimmer and fl ow, and the skin grows warm to the touch. The mark grows warmer each time its power is used over the course of a day; by the time the bearer has expended his full allotment of spell-like abilities, the mark is fever-hot and cannot be used again until it cools. Shapechanging ability and illusions can mimic a dragonmark’s appearance, but usually cannot make it warm to the touch.</p><p>In keeping with their magical nature, dragonmarks are not simply skin deep. If a mark is cut or scarred, it reappears as the skin that bears it magically heals. If a warrior loses the hand that bears his dragonmark, the mark will manifest elsewhere on his body. Creatures under the effect of polymorph, wild shape, and other shapechanging effects retain their dragonmarks unless they specifi cally will them to be hidden.</p><p>Nearly all dragonmarked heirs first manifest the least mark of their house. When a character increases her dragonmark’s power, the mark physically expands. A typical least dragonmark covers an area 2 inches square on the skin. Lesser marks are typically 3–5 inches across, while greater dragonmarks are 6–8 inches. Siberys dragonmarks are vast designs that often cover the bearer’s entire chest or torso.</p><h2>Marked by Blood</h2><p>Dragonmarks are tied to bloodlines. The dragonmarked houses are the descendants of the families that first manifested the marks, and a character with a dragonmark can always find a connection to a dragonmarked house somewhere in the roots of his family tree.</p><p>Though the appearance of marks cannot be consistently predicted, approximately half the children born to dragonmarked parents eventually develop dragonmarks of their own. Common belief holds that parents with powerful marks are more likely to produce gifted children; likewise, children often develop the same powers as their parents. Within House Sivis, members of the Torralyn family typically manifest whispering wind, while Syrralans are more likely to possess the power of arcane mark. Houses often arrange marriages with marks in mind.</p><p>Despite these beliefs, dragonmarks are clearly about more than selective breeding. A child born to parents possessing least marks might later manifest the greater mark, or no mark at all. It is also known that the hybrid races cannot inherit the marks of their parents, so that a human cannot pass the Mark of Making to a half-elf child. A member of a dragonmarked house reincarnated as another race keeps his dragonmark, but children born to such transformed creatures never possess the dragonmark of the parent’s original race. Though legend states that Erandis d’Vol, the last known heir of the Mark of Death, was a half-dragon, only the Mark of Finding is known to cross racial barriers, manifesting on both humans and half-orcs.</p><h2>The Test of Siberys</h2><p>Children are not born with dragonmarks. Rather, a dragonmark most often appears in response to a stressful situation in which the powers of the mark could prove useful. A Jorasco heir feels her dragonmark fl are to life as her best friend lies dying. A Medani scion instinctively realizes the meal he is about to eat is poisoned, and in an instant of burning pain, his mark appears.</p><p>The Test of Siberys—a rite of passage undertaken by the adolescent children of the dragonmarked houses—is rumored to induce the kind of extreme stress needed for dragonmarks to manifest. The test varies from house to house, and is based both on the powers of the mark and the traditions of the family. Outsiders, even those of dragonmarked houses, know little of what goes on in a particular house’s test. Though a person can fail the test and still manifest a mark at a later age (as shown by the fact that a player character can manifest a mark at -any time), this is rare. As a rule, it is assumed that those who fail will never develop a dragonmark.</p><p>The Test of Siberys shapes the future of a character. A successful child emerges as a dragonmarked lord with a vital role to play in his family’s future; one who fails still maintains the privileges of her bloodline, but must fi ght to prove her worth in the mundane offi ces of her house.</p><h2>Dragonmarked Ancestry Feats</h2><h3>Level 01</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.Ooe2Rzyv9lnu547r]{Least Mark} </p><h3>Level 05</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.R5P5LRHtFUiloAYo]{Lesser Mark}</p><h3>Level 09</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.WxDN4X5wASAxzWCX]{Dragonmarked Reserve}</p><h3>Level 13</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.Quz29nNQlVK71jCz]{Greater Mark}</p><h3>Level 17</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.hRcbxwOmPFVsI0xM]{Siberys Mark}</p><h2>Dragonmarked General Feats</h2><h3>Level 01</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.gfCbPsw6HcXYf0i3]{Cannith Forgecraft} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.NnsMCmgbciME9OMG]{Deneith Battle Fortitude} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.DebdIaML5h7uYsmx]{Deneith Battle Stance} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.O9O6qXapTMJVkZnx]{Eye of Medani} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.G5r7bGnWtedY64SW]{Grace of Ghallanda} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.WryjrVsjfCpfNn6n]{Jorasco Treatment} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.Z5noEvrGRjjnEqFc]{Kundarak Insight} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.Ep2kWiklbBCilx67]{Lyrandar Captain} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.P3BGYCHezEfmCzI0]{Lyrandar Stormrider} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.2KsXzERSR3HQceYJ]{Mark of Vengeance} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.OsluUNJGLUol7kxD]{Orien Drive Master} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.ZdsKSb1lSKiH3Vpv]{Orien Traveller} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.Sl5F3xNf8hgqFR4x]{Phiarlan Performer} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.SwT9g2bmLaOkTaZk]{Scribe of Sivis} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.myav2QNeCG7dIlYR]{Shield of Siberys} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.kyy8JFbguEHjirFF]{Tharashk Survivalist} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.eiG7xCdAU3C2RcF3]{Thuranni Spectre} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.XrXH50xMytTSaA9e]{Vadalis Instincts}</p><h3>Level 03</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.m5Sh1ldsMGAlvnlk]{Aberrant Control} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.YKxTB3myrVJnmw9F]{Blood of the Dauntless} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.qyVcMb46gmBqQPNt]{Mark of Vermin} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.A355cFtwqrGBWhzt]{Scribe's Eye} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.P71z1CteCb7PLASi]{Test of Siberys}</p><h3>Level 07</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.TdCJWKQVvgX6KHa4]{Kyber's Reaper} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.fHWjvE2oHhurXxXf]{Orien Battle Stride} |</p><h3>Level 11</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.lLxI7tcqNNrNVwpE]{Dragonmarked Mastery} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.A78GJ73JNPHmfIFw]{Forewarned} |</p><h3>Leve 19</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.pin66dWMHvbh2M8B]{Heart of Siberys} | @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.liMNy4KKGhvoqvhV]{Mark of Destiny} |</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Masters of Trade","type":"text","_id":"s4ksZqwIMhQkK05U","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>The wealth of Khorvaire is built on magic, and the dragonmarked houses are the mortar that holds this magical economy together. Communications, transport, banking, animal husbandry, security—the cornerstones of Eberron’s pseudo-medieval culture are all effectively owned by the dragonmarked houses.</p></blockquote><p>The wealth and influence of the modern houses extends far beyond the power of dragonmarks, however. Though the unique magical abilities of the Mark of Making might have given Cannith smiths an edge over their mundane competitors in centuries past, the spell-like abilities of the dragonmarked are hardly novel in a modern society where adepts, artificers, and other spellcasters are far from rare.</p><p>Rather, it is the carefully crafted histories and reputations of the dragonmarked houses that are responsible for their commercial dominance in present-day Khorvaire. The skillful manipulation of magic and artifice has allowed the houses to use the dragonmarked as the keys by which even greater magic is controlled. House Sivis’s speaking stones, the lightning rail of House Orien, Lyrandar airships, and the Cannith creation forges have all kept the dragonmarked houses at the center of Khorvaire’s economic, military, and social development. As a result, the dragonmarked enjoy a status in Khorvaire that “mundane” wizards and artificers cannot match.</p><h1>History</h1><p>It is often assumed that each house has a single founder: that some ancient Master Cannith was the first person to develop the Mark of Making, with House Cannith born of his children. The truth is not so simple. Each dragonmark first appeared within multiple families, although the marks were bound to specific races and regions. The Mark of Sentinel appeared among the people of Khorvaire’s northern coast, while the Mark of Making was found in the region that would eventually become Cyre. It took generations for these first dragonmarked to realize the significance and power of their marks. During this time, aberrant dragonmarks were as common as those that would come to be seen as true marks, in part because there was no taboo against mingling the bloodlines of dragonmarked families.</p><p>Each dragonmarked family has stories about the exploits of its ancestors, although these are often contradictory. The Lyrriman gnomes of House Sivis claim that their forebears were the first to identify and unify the dragonmarked families, while members of the Vown family of House Cannith make similar claims. Seven dragonmarks were known by the time Karrn the Conqueror sought to bring all Khorvaire under his rule, though the families that bore them were not yet unified. The Sivis League, the Tinkers Guild of Cannith, and the Phiarlans of Aerenal had all laid the groundwork for their future houses, but the Sentinel families of the north were still divided. Some fought alongside Karrn, while others were among his strongest foes.</p><h2>The War of the Mark</h2><p>Though Karrn failed in his conquest, his wars helped raise awareness of the dragonmarked as his soldiers traveled to distant lands. Over the next few centuries, the families began to communicate with one another, with the leaders of Sivis and Cannith taking the greatest initiative. However, it would take a second war to truly bring the families together and forge the foundation of the modern system of houses.</p><p>In the present day, few truths survive from the War of the Mark. History is written by the victors, and the dragonmarked houses have had fifteen hundred years to codify the persecution of the aberrants. What remain are superstitions and folktales: myths of aberrant monsters whose power could shatter cities. Many aberrants were said to be driven mad by the power of their marks—children of Khyber, touched by darkness. Those who bore the true marks were champions blessed by Siberys, or so the dragonmarked claimed. All that is truly known is that the aberrant dragonmarks of old were not bound by bloodline, and that they were as unpredictable as they were powerful.</p><p>Some say the fledgling dragonmarked houses saw a purge of the aberrants as the means to ensure their mystical monopoly. Others believe that the threat of the aberrants was inflated to force the dragonmarked families together. A few sages have suggested that the entire war and its aftermath were the work of the dragons of Argonnessen: that the creation of the houses served the Prophecy, and that the dragonmarked have always been unwitting tools of these ancient wyrms.</p><p>Alliances were forged in the heat of battle, and in the aftermath of the conflict, the leaders of the young houses formed the council of the Twelve. This arcane cabal established the unifying traditions of the dragonmarked, and set the standards by which the houses are governed to this day.</p><h2>The Korth Edicts</h2><p>In time, a new leader set out to unify Khorvaire, and it quickly became apparent to the patriarchs of the dragonmarked houses that Galifar I might well succeed where Karrn had failed. When house leaders met Galifar in the city of Korth at the height of his drive to unite the Five Nations, the would-be king swore to protect the houses, agreeing to a number of provisions that would ensure their continued economic strength. In return, the houses agreed to restrictions on their political power.</p><p>For a thousand years, the Korth Edicts prevented any member of a dragonmarked house from holding a grant of land and placed limits on the size of house enclaves and the armed forces garrisoned there. Special provisions were made for House Deneith, which retained the right to assemble military forces for mercenary service. The edicts further specified that no member of the aristocracy of Galifar could be bound to a member of a dragonmarked house in marriage without one of the two giving up all heritage and rights. Since the houses did not own land, the edicts dictated a system of rents to be paid to the crown in exchange for the territory the houses required for their needs.</p><h2>The Last War</h2><p>When the Kingdom of Galifar was shattered, every nation needed the services of the dragonmarked houses. House Cannith was called on to produce wands, magic siege engines, and mundane arms and armor, in addition to reinforcing walls and fortifications. Cyre made the most extensive use of House Deneith’s services, but other rulers hired mercenaries for critical tasks. House Sivis played a vital role in the coordination of troops, while House Orien and House Lyrandar helped transport goods and soldiers. House Jorasco medics were in high demand. With the hounds of war baying and the dragonmarked houses ascending, the Korth Edicts were quietly set aside during the last war. Even now, many house enclaves maintain forces beyond those allowed by the edicts, and a number of houses have successfully claimed land and holdings of their own. One notable example is Stormhome in Aundair, which is for all intents and purposes a territory of House Lyrandar.</p><p>In the wake of the war, the status of the edicts remains uncertain. The Treaty of Thronehold called on the authority of the Korth Edicts when House Cannith was ordered to shut down the creation forges. Though Cannith acquiesced, the house was in chaos at the time, its leadership shattered on the Day of Mourning. Today, more and more dragonmarked nobles are holding to the opinion that the edicts were an agreement with the King of Galifar, not the rulers of the Five Nations. It remains to be seen whether the Thronehold nations can join together to enforce the terms of the edicts once more—or whether the growing economic and military power of the houses will allow them to dictate new terms to the nobility.</p><h1>House Enclaves</h1><p>In a small community, a dragonmarked house might be represented by a single business. A village might have a Jorasco healing house, a tiny Sivis message station, or a Gold Dragon Inn of House Ghallanda, all run by individuals. Large cities and metropolises have dozens of such house businesses, but they also have enclaves—the citadels of the dragonmarked houses.</p><p>A house enclave is a self-contained community where a member of a house can spend months without ever needing to leave. The center of the enclave includes production, training, and administration facilities, living quarters, and shops catering to the everyday needs of its inhabitants. This region of an enclave is reserved for the private business of the house, and strangers are allowed in only under special circumstances. As a result, wealthy heirs of the house often maintain secondary residences beyond an enclave for the purpose of entertaining. The center of an enclave is a private fortress. Depending on the house, security could be an internal affair. Alternatively, it might be undertaken by arrangement with House Deneith, House Medani, or House Kundarak.</p><p>The secondary ring of the enclave is where business occurs, and is the site of guild offices, shops, and other facilities. Customers, dragonmarked heirs, and guild members with no family connections all cross paths here. Though the everyday services of house and guild can be found across Khorvaire, a house’s most expensive services are exclusive to its enclaves. Courier stations are common throughout Sharn, for example, but teleportation is available only at the Orien enclave in Dragon Towers. Part shopping center, part production facility, and part suburb, a house enclave is often the economic center of the community in which it is found.</p><h1>Hierarchy</h1><p>Each house has its own distinctive traditions, some examined in detail in each house's article. However, most houses follow a similar leadership model. The ultimate authority within a house is the patriarch (or matriarch), who oversees the house’s ruling council. The patriarch is appointed by a council of viceroys; term of office and the means by which an inept patriarch can be removed vary from house to house. Many patriarchs also take the title of Baron.</p><p>The patriarch is advised by a council whose members represent each of the nations in which the house operates. The members of this council are known as the lords seneschal. In addition to the regional lords, additional lords seneschal are appointed by a patriarch to act as his personal representatives. A seneschal can be dispatched to investigate a corrupt or ineffective viceroy, or to negotiate an especially critical agreement between houses or nations. Houses with multiple guilds often have an additional lord seneschal appointed to each one. These individuals serve as the ultimate guildmaster, coordinating reports from each region and advising the patriarch.</p><p>Viceroys (so named regardless of gender) are regional directors. A viceroy manages guild operations and house affairs in her assigned region. This office is bestowed by vote of the local council of viceroys, and while a viceroy can theoretically be stripped of her rank, the position is hereditary in most houses. Long-standing alliances ensure that viceroyalties remain under the dominion of particular branches of a family.</p><p>The next tier splits into two paths. Administrators who specifically oversee guild functions are known as masters, while those who manage the internal affairs of a house are ministers. Beneath these come the standard hirelings of the house, whose titles are simply descriptive. In House Ghallanda, the Viceroy of Sharn oversees all activities in the region, and the Master of Agriculture coordinates supplies and the purchase and distribution of foodstuffs, but each individual hostel is run by a house member with the lofty title of innkeeper.</p><p>In addition to these offices, any member of the house who has manifested a dragonmark (including player characters) is allowed the title of lord or lady. This title does not grant any sort of privilege within the house, however: Lord Cantal might work in the mail room, while an exceptional administrator who never develops a dragonmark could work her way up to seize a viceroyalty.</p><h1>The Twelve</h1><p>At the conclusion of the War of the Mark, Lord Hadran d’Cannith suggested that the houses formally cement their alliance by creating a citadel—a center for research and study of both arcane magic and the potential of the dragonmarked. Though there were only ten dragonmarked houses at the time, the architect and artificer Alder d’Cannith convinced the committee to name the institute the Twelve, based on his belief that there were twelve true dragonmarks in addition to the shattered Mark of Death. Alder was a brilliant man whose works had played a critical role in the War of the Mark, and the members of the committee humored him—though few expected the remaining two marks to appear. (The remaining two marks, Warding and Finding, were not “discovered” until after the creation of the Kingdom of Galifar.)</p><p>In the beginning, the Twelve played a critical role in shaping the dragonmarked houses, but as the houses have grown in power and spread across the land, its influence has diminished. Nonetheless, the institute remains one of the premier centers for magical research in Khorvaire. By combining the skills and mystical talents of the different marks, the wizards and artificers of the Twelve have created remarkable items. It took the combined skills of House Orien, House Cannith, and House Kundarak to create the safe-deposit vaults that allow Kundarak customers to deposit goods at one bank and withdraw them across the continent. Airships, the lightning rail, even the warforged—these marvels could not have been accomplished without the spirit of cooperation and discovery found among the Twelve.</p><p>Should you rise high in the favor of a dragonmarked house, you might be able to call on the resources of the Twelve. This institute possesses impressive mystical workshops, vast arcane libraries, and the talents of some of the most gifted artificers and wizards in Khorvaire—all of which could prove quite useful to an adventurer. In theory, the Twelve is a neutral foundation: a resource serving all houses equally. However, some speak of a secret cabal at the heart of the Twelve that seeks a return to the days when the institute shaped the future of Khorvaire. Such a group might hope to overturn the Korth Edicts and see the dragonmarked houses rival Khorvaire’s nations in strength.</p><h1>The Guilds</h1><p>The vast majority of the people who are employed by a dragonmarked house have no blood tie to the houses. Instead, they belong to one of the house guilds. These guilds are vast, sprawling entities that cover a wide range of occupations.</p><p>Why join a house guild? To begin with, each guild maintains a network of trade schools. The price of education includes a period of service to the house, along with a long-term tithe. Both vary based on the amount of gold the apprentice can bring to the table, but a house always looks for a long-term investment from its students.</p><p>Students of a guild school must sign contracts forbidding them from future competition with the business of the house. A would-be magewright can learn his craft at House Cannith’s academy easily enough, but he must swear to serve the Fabricators Guild thereafter. Should he start an independent business that challenges the guild, House Cannith will bring the full weight of the law to bear.</p><p>Resources are a tangible benefit of joining a guild. An alchemist associated with the Fabricators Guild purchases exotic components and reagents directly from House Cannith, providing him with supplies that independent competitors might have a hard time acquiring. As such, guild merchants sell goods or services that independents simply cannot provide. The reputation of a guild is also a powerful tool. When people are paying 50 gp for a potion of cure light wounds, few of them will take a chance on any vendor not displaying a House Jorasco banner.</p><p>A guild merchant gets more business, but he must pay dues to the house along with a share of his profits. In addition, he must meet the standards of quality and behavior set forth by the house. Observers can appear at any time to audit a guild business, and members who fail to uphold the standards of the house can be penalized or stripped of guild status.</p><h2>Guild Membership</h2><p>Each of the three types of guild membership reflects a different connection to a dragonmarked house.</p><p>The most common type of guild businesses are those licensed by the guild but not bound to its structure. Licensees are trained by the guild and pledge to uphold its standards, but receive no regular direction from guild administrators. A licensed inn is named by the owner and has its own menu, but the Ghallanda seal on the door promises courteous behavior and fair prices. Likewise, a sea captain licensed by the Windwrights Guild is not bound by the routes or schedules of the guild. However, his ship must pass inspections, and he must uphold the honor code of House Lyrandar, in addition to paying the house a percentage of his profits. A licensed business can display the guild seal using black paint or ink.</p><p>Bound businesses are those funded by a guild in exchange for a greater share of profits and a controlling hand. Though a licensed Lyrandar captain owns his ship, a bound captain’s ship belongs to the guild, and guild administrators dictate his routes. The Gold Dragon Inn is a popular bound business of Ghallanda’s Hostelers Guild, and an innkeeper who runs one is expected to prepare the same menu as every other Gold Dragon Inn. Licensed businesses often have their own flavor, but a customer who goes to a bound business knows exactly what to expect. Bound businesses display the guild seal in silver, and the names of many bound businesses are as well known as the houses themselves.</p><p>Rarest among the guilds are the house arms: businesses directly managed by blood heirs of the house. House arms are not a separate type of business, but are themselves either licensed or bound. A Sivis scribe might choose to head up a bound house arm (for example, a notary’s office operated according to terms set by the house) while a Tharashk inquisitive establishes his own licensed house arm (a private investigation service that can be run according to the character’s whim). House arms are simply representative of a direct connection to a house’s hierarchy that most licensed or bound businesses do not have. These businesses display the guild seal in gold, and often display the seal of the house as well.</p><h2>Guild Standards</h2><p>The Core Rulebook give flat rates for goods and services. A longsword costs 1gp, and deals 1d8 points of slashing damage. Why? Because each blade is crafted to standards set down by the guilds. When a Thrane fighter loses his sword in Sharn, he can go to a smith of the Fabricators Guild and purchase an identical blade with an identical balance. If he goes to an independent smith, he might find different sorts of weapons available, almost always higher-priced than guild standards—but not always better in quality.</p><p>Prices could rise by up to 20% for characters dealing with non-guild merchants. Guild merchants can undersell others because of volume of sales, access to a greater quantity of raw materials, and streamlined methods of production. Furthermore, goods purchased from independents might fail to meet guild standards—which is to say, be worth the values set forth in the Core Rulebook. A longsword purchased from an independent smith might have a reduced damage dice. A healing potion might have less potency than one produced by House Jorasco (if it is even magic at all). Many independents are skilled, honest folk, but without the guild assurance of quality, the buyer had best beware.</p><p>While this approach encourages individuals to patronize guild businesses, characters requiring exotic items will often need to seek out an independent. The point of exotic weapons is that they are rare and unusual. As such, they make a poor investment for a house business. Someone looking for rare (and even some uncommon) weapons won’t find one on the wall of a guild smithy.</p><h2>Guild Wars</h2><p>House administrators seek to squelch competition between guild businesses. House Cannith has fixed the price of longswords at 1gp across Khorvaire, and every licensed or bound smith is expected to hold to that price. Though adventurers might encounter licensed artisans fighting economic duels in the shadows, a more common scenario is independents being pressured to join a guild. The houses seek to maintain a monopoly on their trades, and if a master artisan begins to draw significant business away from a guild, its house will take action. A guild representative might appear, extolling the benefits of membership. The merchant might become the victim of a campaign slandering his skills. The local guild viceroy might use his political influence to tangle the independent in red tape or strangle his access to supplies. If all else fails, an independent might find himself dealing with burglars, vandals, or even threats to his life.</p><h1>Dragonmarks and the Draconic Prophecy</h1><p>For centuries, explorers have noted strange symbols similar to dragonmarks formed by such seemingly random forces as coral growth, lava flows, and earthquakes. These are the symbols of the draconic Prophecy studied by the great dragons of Argonnessen. Dragonmarks caused an upheaval among the dragons when they first appeared, and the Chamber has monitored the marked races ever since. It is difficult for humans and their kin to grasp the vast mysteries of the Draconic Prophecy. Some scholars claim that the dragonmarks represent primal forces, and are tied to both the moons of Eberron and the planes. As such, a dragonmarked heir is a pawn of prophecy: a tool that can be used to shape the future.</p><p>The statement that a vile demon can be destroyed only by “Storm, Shadow, and the Servant of the Forge” might refer to vague legend—or it might refer to heirs of House Lyrandar, House Thuranni, and House Cannith working in concert. Members of the Chamber sometimes assemble teams of dragonmarked heirs to meet certain conditions. In other cases, the convergence of heirs can have its own significance. Just as a shaman reads meaning into the random patterns of bone chips, a student of the Prophecy can dredge omens from the presence of particular dragonmarks in a specific location.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"The Mark of Detection","type":"text","_id":"I1SVCTLepDWHHD36","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<img src=\"modules/pf2e-for-eberron/images/MarkOfDetection.png\" class=\" centered\" width=\"131\" height=\"142\" /><blockquote><p>The Mark of Detection is an inquisitive's dream.

If you want someone to anticipate the threat and make sure you aren’t even in the room with whoever’s holding that blade, that’s what we do. - Baron Trelib d’Medani</p></blockquote><p>Leader: Baron Trelib d’Medani<br />Headquarters: Tower of Inquisition (Wroat, Breland)</p><p>Of the twelve dragonmarked houses, House Medani has the lowest profile—and that’s how the house’s heirs prefer it. The half-elves of Medani bear the Mark of Detection. Through the Warning Guild, they offer their services as bodyguards, inquisitives, and sentries to clients across Khorvaire.</p><p>Medani is the youngest of the dragonmarked houses to originate within the Five Nations, with the Mark of Detection appearing only shortly before the War of the Mark. The Medani families banded together in preGalifar Breland prior to that conflict, but had few aspirations beyond being left alone. Only in the aftermath of the War of the Mark did Medani’s elders bow to the pressure of the other houses and take their place among the dragonmarked.</p><p>Despite often strained relations with the other houses, Medani’s collective voice carries weight. The house’s warnings are ignored at the listener’s peril, but Medani’s iconoclastic nature makes it sometimes difficult to work with.</p><h2>Warning Signs</h2><p>Though any number of organizations might claim a lock on the truth, House Medani can back that claim. Those who possess Medani’s mark can sense arcane and divine power, the taint of poison, unseen intruders, or magical observation from a world away. All Medani heirs train in the use of logic, perception, and techniques for assembling fragments of evidence into a recognizable whole. As allies, they are formidable; as enemies, even more so.</p><p>The Medani alliance existed before Galifar: a collection of families based in the former Medani provinces of what would one day become Breland. Already accustomed to blending into human or elf society, the half-elves of the Medani concealed their dragonmarks when they first appeared. A close-knit society, they were content to use the Mark of Detection quietly, building a reputation as bodyguards and scouts while attempting to avoid the growing conflicts of the other dragonmarked.</p><p>House Cannith discovered Medani partway through the War of the Mark. At first, it was thought that the Mark of Detection might simply be a prevalent aberrant dragonmark, but that conjecture was quickly discarded. Cannith finally tracked down the elders of the Medani families and convinced them (some say threatened) to take their place alongside the other dragon marked houses.</p><p>Even today, distaste for authority runs strong in Medani, giving rise to aloofness that many dragonmarked ascribe to the house. Medani is forthright in its views on house politics and is an active participant in the Twelve, but representatives of the other houses sometimes claim that House Medani works against their interests as often as it supports them.</p><h2>Friends in High Places</h2><p>By virtue of its geographic origins and current leadership, however, House Medani has a close relationship with the Brelish crown. The house is based in Wroat, and Baron Trelib is a long-standing friend of King Boranel. During the Last War, Medani maintained the same steadfast neutrality as the other dragonmarked houses. However, it is rumored that a good portion of the wartime intelligence directed to Breland from its allies in Zilargo might have originated with Medani—the house using connections of Sivis to assist its homeland while maintaining necessary secrecy.</p><p>Though the dragonmarked houses are directed to carry on their mercantile operations at a neutral distance from the nobility of the new Khorvaire, Trelib’s close relationship with King Boranel often causes the house to deal more favorably with Breland than with the rest of the Five Nations. Trelib is known to have supplied a number of Medani operatives to Boranel’s court, and is also charged with discovering who assassinated Boranel’s first wife, Queen Chaseva. Those close to Trelib speak of his utter devotion to solving the murder, but all his efforts to date have proved fruitless.</p><p>Though this close relationship angers many outside Breland (nobles and dragonmarked alike), some Brelish have their own concerns. Within the King’s Dark Lanterns, high-placed operatives wonder openly whether Boranel is in fact being played by Medani—and whether Trelib’s long years of friendship have enabled him to place deep-cover agents within the ranks of the Brelish court or the Lanterns themselves.</p><h2>Estranged Siblings</h2><p>Though both Lyrandar and Medani are made up of half-elves, little love is lost between the two houses. Unlike Ghallanda and Jorasco, Lyrandar and Medani formed at different times, in different areas, and under very different circumstances. Lyrandar is ambitious and ostentatious, while Medani is focused and withdrawn. The former prides itself on its diplomacy and political acumen, while the latter has no fear of playing favorites.</p><p>Despite their dissimilar temperaments, the two houses have some common ground. A subtle disdain for those who feel entitled to power shows in their dealings with the other houses (particularly Cannith), as does a preference for working with the common folk of Khorvaire rather than the elite. On rare occasions, they have supported one another against initiatives among the houses and movements by the nobility to limit the power of the dragonmarked. Such alliances are short-lived, however, and often conveniently forgotten.</p><h2>House Medani in the World</h2><p>In a world in which secrets, espionage, and assassination can be bought and sold on the open market, the role of the counterspy takes on great significance. House Phiarlan, House Thuranni, the King’s Dark Lanterns, the Royal Eyes, the Aurum, the Emerald Claw, and uncountable other organizations weave their webs of intrigue across Khorvaire—all the while cursing the agents of House Medani who undo their well wrought plans.</p><p>Beyond the house’s role as a counterintelligence agency, Medani (like Lyrandar) is looked to for leadership by many Khoravar. However, the house accepts this role as an offshoot of its position as a protector—not as a gods-given right.</p><p>As befits a house proud of its iconoclast status, House Medani is a tightly knit group. It is among the smallest of the houses in population, and individuals are encouraged to have strong bonds to their extended families. Factional disagreements arise within the house from time to time, but have never threatened to become schism or open conflict. Outside the house, relations between Medani, Phiarlan, and Thuranni are sometimes strained, with the three houses often working on different sides of the same intelligence-gathering operations.</p><p>The relationship between House Medani and House Lyrandar is a complex one. Though precious little common ground or competition exists between their mercantile operations, the two half-elf houses have very different views of their racial heritage. Lyrandar had centuries to spread before the appearance of the Mark of Detection, and takes as its mandate the continued development of an inclusive Khoravar race. Even before the appearance of their dragonmarks, the Medani had rejected this view, content to see themselves as heirs to two worlds rather than the builders of one.</p><p>Today, where Lyrandar seeks racial isolation, Medani sees greater strength in being a bridge between two cultures. House Medani’s encouragement of occasional intermarriage between half-elf and elf or human is abhorrent to many Lyrandar, who are not afraid to make their feelings known.</p><p>Despite the inherent separation of the Warning Guild from the house, strong functional ties bind the members of both. Medani operatives outside the Warning Guild work mostly to collect, collate, and decipher the information gained from the plots the guild uncovers, and both sides look out for the other. In its own way, House Medani’s store of intelligence might be the equal of either House Phiarlan or House Thuranni, but with one significant difference: Medani’s information is never sold. Rather, the house uses the facts, rumors, and speculation at its disposal solely in the service of its clients—and sometimes to convince prospective clients that they need Medani protection.</p><h2>House Medani's Holdings</h2><p>In keeping with its role as a house of counterspies, Medani keeps a low profile even in its ancestral home in Wroat. The Medani enclave is a connected network of unmarked buildings within sight of both Brokenblade Castle and Parliament Hall. It is not marked on any map, and those not already aware of its existence would be hard-pressed to pick its well-guarded doors out from among the private apartments and shops that surround it.</p><p>The Tower of Inquisition, Medani’s center of interrogation and incarceration, is the only part of the enclave known by name among the other dragonmarked houses. A nondescript stone building overlooking the river, it is said to be as well guarded as Brokenblade Castle itself. Underground passages and permanent dimension doors are said to connect the tower and the castle, created so that the enclave might be used as a secret refuge in the Last War, but this rumor has never been confirmed.</p><p>In addition to its ancestral hold, House Medani maintains enclaves in Fairhaven, Flamekeep, Korth, Sharn, and Trolanport. It has smaller centers in Newthrone, Pylas Talaear, Stormreach, Taer Valaestas, and Varna. Medani outposts can be found in smaller cities across Khorvaire, including Rhukaan Draal in Darguun.</p><h2>Guilds of House Medani</h2><p>House Medani and the Warning Guild are synonymous in the minds of many Khorvairians, few of whom realize the degree of official separation that stands between them. Rather than a simple extension of the house, the Warning Guild has grown into an affiliated but largely independent entity. The Mark of Detection often leads to meddling in unpleasant affairs; official separation keeps the house at a safe distance whenever the unpleasantness turns out to involve the nobility or the dragonmarked houses themselves.</p><p>While the Warning Guild provides valuable experience and training for its members, House Medani’s ministers realize that not everyone’s gifts are best suited to that path. Heirs and house members whose skills lie elsewhere are encouraged to pursue them, as long as those pursuits benefit the house eventually.</p><h3>Warning Guild</h3><p>The Warning Guild is administered by members of House Medani, and it reports to the Medani patriarch and his council quarterly with financial reports and news of particular interest to the house leadership. Members of the Warning Guild do not gather information in the same manner as a Phiarlan agent, a Thuranni operative, or even a Ghallanda barkeep. Rather, they piece together a map of the subtle plots threading Khorvaire by keeping those plots from coming to pass. Only when Aurum agents are revealed within the Brelish court can the chain of orders and intrigue that brought them there be carefully unraveled. When an assassination attempt against a Cannith seneschal is prevented, it unlocks layers of scheming that would otherwise never come to light.</p><p>The Warning Guild provides certification and contract employment for bodyguards, inquisitives, and sentries across Khorvaire, though the bulk of its work is in the larger cities. Bodyguards in Khorvaire can be hired from any number of sources, but those of the Warning Guild are not hired primarily for their muscle or skill with a blade. Rather, House Medani specializes in anticipating attacks and preventing them before strength and steel are ever needed. The guild has enclaves throughout the Five Nations, but they are always small and unmarked. If a potential guild member can’t fi nd the place on her own, that doesn’t bode well for her future in that line of work.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"The Mark of Finding","type":"text","_id":"amKWIFKf6DPQ1meg","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<img src=\"modules/pf2e-for-eberron/images/MarkOfFinding.png\" class=\" centered\" width=\"131\" height=\"142\" /><blockquote><p>The Mark of Finding sharpens the senses, guiding the hunter to prey.

I use mine to find fugitives in the slums of Sharn. I’m still a hunter. I always find my mark. -Hondar’Aashta, Tharashk bounty hunter</p></blockquote><p>Leader: The Triumvirate (Maagrim Torrn, Khandar’aashta, and Daric Velderan)<br />Headquarters: Zarash’ak, Shadow Marches</p><p>House Tharashk carries the Mark of Finding, and its powers allow Tharashk heirs to track lost relics and living creatures alike. The ancestors of the house were savage hunters who drew on the power of their marks to track prey through the murky depths of the Shadow Marches. The spirit of the hunter lives on in the house today. Though one of the youngest houses, Tharashk possesses a vibrant competitive spirit that drives its efforts to increase its influence.</p><h2>Born of Two Bloods</h2><p>For thousands of years, the Shadow Marches were the domain of the orcs. It was a land scarred by the ancient conflict with the daelkyr, where the descendants of the first Gatekeepers and those corrupted by the touch of Xoriat continued to battle in the darkness. Fifteen hundred years ago, humans came to the Shadow Marches: refugees from the distant land of Sarlona fleeing the growing power of the Inspired. Though many of the orcs of the Marches met the first waves of settlers with hostility, a handful of tribes welcomed these strangers. Over time, this union of cultures produced both the clans of the modern age and the jhorgun’taal: “children of two bloods,” or half-orcs.</p><p>When the Mark of Finding appeared among the clans five centuries later, it was carried by humans and half-orcs alike. Some considered this to be a divine gift to the humans and half-bloods to make up for their physical frailty—a magic mark in lieu of the great strength and dark-piercing eyes that Eberron had granted the orcs. The mark appeared among three clans—Aashta, Velderan, and Torrn—and over the next five centuries, the hunters of these clans would become legends within the Marches.</p><p>In 498 YK, expeditions from central Khorvaire reached the Shadow Marches. One such expedition was led by Zil gnomes, who had calculated that the distant land might hold rich deposits of dragonshards. In this, they were correct, but the discovery of the Mark of Finding was an even greater treasure.</p><p>The clan leaders were cunning and capable, but the Sivis emissaries were intent on working with the Marchers, not exploiting them. With the assistance of the gnomes, the three great clans and their lesser kin joined together to form House Tharashk, an Orc word meaning “united.” For the symbol of the house, the first Triumvirate chose the dragonne, touched with the power of dragons and a fierce hunter in the legends of both Marcher orcs and Sarlonan humans.</p><p>Tharashk was founded on the dragonshard trade, its dragonmarked heirs employing the Mark of Finding to locate shard fields while their unmarked kin extracted those shards. The clan leaders were ambitious, however, and not content to remain in the shadows. Over the last three centuries, the house has spread across the world. Tharashk prospectors explore the darkest corners of Eberron, drawing dragonshards and other valuables from Q’barra, the Demon Wastes, and Xen’drik. City-dwellers sell their services as inquisitives and bounty hunters.</p><p>Since the rise of the Daughters of Sora Kell in Droaam, members of House Tharashk have served as intermediaries between the realm of monsters and the east, bartering the service of monstrous mercenaries across Khorvaire. The house takes great pride in having forced mainstream Khorvaire to recognize that orcs and half-orcs are worthy of the same courtesies and opportunities as the races already established in society. Now, house members have used their status to do the same for Droaam’s monstrous races, who can be found living and working across Khorvaire. Not all are pleased with this turn of events—particularly House Deneith.</p><p>Today, Tharashk is said to be working with the Inspired to locate crystal wastes in Xen’drik that are key to the creation of Riedran crysteel, and even sending expeditions to the Frostfell. Tharashk might be the youngest of the houses, but it is filled with fire. Its leaders intend to make their mark on Eberron, and the house is always searching for new opportunities to do so.</p><h2>House Tharashk in the World</h2><p>The services of House Tharashk can prove useful to adventurers as well as their enemies. Explorers, bounty hunters, inquisitives, and ambitious merchant princes can all wear the mark of the dragonne, and each serves a different role in a campaign.</p><p>Due to the guidance of House Sivis in the formative years of the house, Tharashk uses the traditional dragonmarked structure of viceroys, ministers, and masters. In addition, family plays a central role in House Tharashk, in the form of the alliance of three great clans: Aashta, Torrn, and Velderan. Each clan controls its own distinct territory, so that challenges within that territory must come from within the ruling clan. Instead of having a single matriarch or patriarch, the house is controlled by the Triumvirate, consisting of one leader (known as a triumvir) from each clan. The current triumvirs are Daric d’Velderan, Khundar’aashta, and Maagrim Torrn d’Tharashk. Humans and half-orcs often hold the house’s leadership, though there have been orc triumvirs and viceroys in the past, especially among the Torrn clan.</p><p>Tension is acute within the house, especially between those Aashta heirs who revere the Dragon Below and the Torrn Gatekeepers. Feuds between clans occasionally have deadly consequences, but the house’s leaders have largely managed to keep their kin focused on common goals, and dedicated to maintaining the strength of Tharashk.</p><p>Unknown even to most house members, the Valshar’ak Seal is a union of dedicated Gatekeepers who have vowed to use the resources of Tharashk to fulfill their ancient duties, and to prevent the Dragon Below from doing the same. Maagrim Torrn supports the Seal, but her position as triumvir prevents her from taking an active role with the group. Currently, the Valshar’ak Seal is led by the venerable Urlev Torrn.</p><h2>House Tharashk's Holdings</h2><p>The Triumvirate of House Tharashk is based in Zarash’ak, the largest city in the Shadow Marches. House Tharashk wields considerable power and authority in Zarash’ak. In addition to heirs of the house, the enclave includes a number of monstrous guardians, laborers, and ambassadors from Droaam.</p><h2>Guilds of House Tharashk</h2><p>For all its short history, House Tharashk has been synonymous with the Finders Guild, and the operations of house and guild are common throughout rural and urban Khorvaire.</p><h3>Finders Guild</h3><p>Centuries ago, the dragonmarked members of House Tharashk decided to market their unique services to tribes and nations that neighbored their native Shadow Marches. While the dragonmarked inquisitives and explorers of the house were quite adept at their trade, they discovered many other individuals offering similar services. To capitalize on the entire market, the house created the Finders Guild, inviting others to join so they could benefit from each other’s knowledge and provide a network of resources across the continent.</p><p>Now, the Finders Guild is still primarily composed of House Tharashk members, but it also includes many independent inquisitives, bounty hunters, explorers, and prospectors. House Tharashk manages the operations of the guild from its enclaves in major cities across Khorvaire. If something needs to be found, the first place to turn is the Finders Guild.</p><p>Dragonshard prospecting isn’t the only function of the Finders Guild, but a significant part of the income produced by the guild comes from the acquisition of dragonshards of all varieties. The Mark of Finding gives Tharashk prospectors a leg up on the competition, since they can use their dragonmark magic to more quickly locate dragonshard deposits. Through the Finders Guild, House Tharashk has control of, or at least prospecting rights for, most Eberron dragonshard fields in western Khorvaire, including the most lucrative fields in the Shadow Marches and Droaam. The guild maintains a presence in Stormreach, organizing expeditions into the wilds of Xen’drik to acquire Eberron or Siberys dragonshards.</p><p>Even expeditions into the depths of Khyber usually involve the Finders Guild in some way. Either the expedition is following a map provided by the guild, is led by a guildmember guide, or will sell unearthed Khyber shards to the guild, provided it returns to the surface.</p><p>Even if the Finders Guild isn’t directly involved with a dragonshard prospecting expedition, it is likely that the guild soon learns of its existence. The guild pays competitive prices for unattuned dragonshards, with a premium if the origin of the shards is also provided. Of course, with the inquisitives and bounty hunters at the guild’s disposal, a new Khyber cave or Siberys fall zone won’t stay secret for long, at least within the guild.</p><p>The Finders Guild sponsors a number of activities that draw the interest of adventurers. Exploration, investigation, bounty hunting, and the search for wealth are all fine endeavors for a PC. Add to this the fact that House Tharashk maintains enclaves throughout Khorvaire, and characters would always have a source of potential employment and adventure.</p><p>The Finders Guild is operated by House Tharashk, and the leaders of the guild are humans and half-orcs that bear the Mark of Finding. The headquarters of the guild is located with the house headquarters in the city of Zarash’ak, in the Shadow Marches. There, a council convenes to discuss all aspects of the guild’s business: mining, prospecting, bounty hunting and tracking, investigation, and the new mercenary enterprise.</p><p>The head of dragonshard acquisition, which includes mining and prospecting regarding dragonshards, is Vurlaak d’Tharashk. Vurlaak has a particular knack for judging market conditions, and he has kept the dragonshard business profitable since before the end of the Last War. He is keenly interested in expanding guild operations into Q’barra and Xen’drik, because he fears that the Eberron shard fields in the Shadow Marches will eventually be depleted, and looks to those locations as new sources of revenue.</p><p>Vurlaak is well respected by other members of the guild and the house. He proved his dedication to the success of the Finders Guild by once personally leading a team of prospectors on a Khyber shard reclamation mission. Only half the team returned, but the spoils of that mission alone funded the operations of the guild for many months. When not in the Shadow Marches, Vurlaak attends to guild business throughout Khorvaire, flying from city to city on an airship on loan from House Lyrandar.</p><p>Most members of the Finders Guild are happy to be a part of it. The guild provides consistent leads for work that the members would have a difficult time arranging independently, due to the capricious nature of the professions that the guild represents. With the Finders Guild, a bounty hunter can start off after a new mark, a prospector can get a new lead on a lode, and an investigator can start the trail of a new mystery.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"The Mark of Handling","type":"text","_id":"YuXHlPWY0LUxymk0","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<img src=\"modules/pf2e-for-eberron/images/MarkOfHandling.png\" class=\" centered\" width=\"131\" height=\"142\" /><blockquote><p>The Mark of Handling gives its bearer a primal connection to beasts and the natural world, granting the power to calm and coax.

A beast is a tool. Our role is to find the right tool for the task and to make sure they’re of the finest quality. Nature is our kingdom; never forget that we were born to rule it. -Dalin d’Vadalis</p></blockquote><p>Leader: Dalin d’Vadalis<br />Headquarters: Foalswood (near Varna, Eldeen Reaches)</p><p>House Vadalis is arguably the most innocuous of the dragonmarked houses. Its gifts do not win battles or drive the commerce of nations; the house was not instrumental in the Last War or in establishing the traditions of the houses. Its mark allows it to better care for and control animals; while useful, this ability is hardly the stuff of legend.</p><p>Yet somehow, this inconspicuous house carries more than its share of controversy. During the War of the Mark, it was rumored that House Vadalis bred arcane beasts so horrifying that they were later banned and destroyed. Valenar refuses to allow Vadalis heirs to even enter the country, and the house’s bonding of magic with nature alternately inspires wonder or hostility among the people of Khorvaire.</p><h2>Family Business</h2><p>The dragonmarked houses consist of extended families—separate bloodlines that all trace back to a common ancestry. However, the sheer size of most houses means that few house members can claim any sort of relationship outside their immediate family unit within the house. House Vadalis is the exception to this rule.</p><p>While the other houses have done their best to increase their size and influence on Khorvaire, House Vadalis has taken almost the opposite stance. Every Vadalis heir over the age of 10 can recite his family lineage on both sides for several generations. This is not a matter of rote memorization for the purpose of pride, but information that sees daily use. Through this knowledge, any heirs of House Vadalis can determine their exact relationship to one another within an hour’s time. This in turn creates a strong bond between them. It is one thing to work alongside someone who shares your name, but another to aid your grandmother’s sister’s great-grandson—at least to a Vadalis heir.</p><p>House Vadalis is a family first and a business second. Commercial deals that might threaten the larger family unit are ignored, while plans with less profit that accommodate the house’s structure are taken up instead. The other houses are routinely astounded by the Vadalis way, often ridiculing the house’s limited wealth and influence, but Vadalis simply takes a different view of the world. In their minds, no one of their blood is a stranger, and no amount of money can take the place of kin.</p><h2>House Vadalis in the World</h2><p>House Vadalis makes an excellent option for working a dragonmarked house into a wilderness or rural campaign. Vadalis rangers and fighters can be encountered across Khorvaire, wherever people are scarce and animals abound. Whether wandering the open road, stationed at remote outposts, or conducting business in small towns across the continent, Vadalis heirs can motivate players to look beyond the cities for their adventures.</p><p>The most famous member of House Vadalis is technically no longer a member at all. The consort of Queen Aurala of Aundair, Sasik d’Vadalis renounced all position and ties to his house upon marrying the queen, though he remains a member of the Vadalis family. His brother is the patriarch of the house, Dalin d’Vadalis (CG male human expert 8), and the two remain close despite Sasik’s change in station.</p><p>House Vadalis is the only human house to have its center of power outside the Five Nations. Its members have no titles, not even the patriarch. Vadalis makes no claim to nobility or greatness, a fact that aggravates the more ambitious houses. Outside the house, guild members who have attained excellence in their fields are known as breedmasters, but this title is designed solely to inspire confidence in those who have business dealings with the house. No set council advises the patriarch; rather, decisions are a family affair, with all adults present in the enclave giving their opinions on important matters. These meetings can be long and chaotic, but members of Vadalis consider them integral to the function of the house. Patriarchs who ignore the will of others quickly find themselves replaced.</p><h2>House Vadalis's Holdings</h2><p>House Vadalis had its home in the western wilds of Aundair long before Galifar came to pass. When the Eldeen Reaches withdrew from Aundair, the house saw little reason to leave.</p><p>The small city of Varna acts as the seat of Vadalis power. Most of its people work in some way for the income generated by Vadalis trade, but the house uses its enclave within the city primarily as a place to conduct business with the outside world. The majority of its research and bloodline development takes place at Foalswood, the sprawling ranch that the Vadalis family calls home.</p><p>A far cry from the defensible keeps maintained by other houses, Foalswood is a complex of barns, warehouses, and homes nestled among the rolling hills around Varna. Though one of the smallest house headquarters by population, Foalswood features uncountable acres of pasture and meadow where Vadalis animals roam. Though he spends his days in Varna, the patriarch lives at Foalswood, as do most of the heirs to the house. The largest building designed for human use is the ranch’s great meeting house.</p><p>Outside Varna, House Vadalis maintains enclaves in small towns across the Reaches, including Merylsward, Delethorn, and Erlaskar. It has a large ranch outside the village of Shavalant and another on the outskirts of Wroat. The house also has holdings in the cities of Fairhaven, Flamekeep, Newthrone, Pylas Talaear, Sharn, Stormreach, and Trolanport. .</p><h2>Guilds of House Vadalis</h2><p>House Vadalis runs the Handlers Guild, devoted to the business of breeding, caring for, and selling prize animal stock. Membership in the Handlers Guild is not mandatory for all house members, but for heirs who intend to work outside the main enclaves, the guild establishes a good working relationship with ranchers and other breeders.</p><p>In the same way, membership in the Handlers Guild is not automatically a stepping-stone to status in the house. Both guild and house are vital in their own right, and joining one solely to make progress in the other is actively discouraged.</p><h3>Handler's Guild</h3><p>The Handlers Guild is a mercantile guild under the control of House Vadalis. Unlike the dragonmarked houses in which guilds control industry while the house handles administrative tasks, Vadalis divides responsibilities in a different fashion.</p><p>The house handles research into new types of animals and new breeding programs, as well as the sale, care, and training of those animals. The Handlers Guild functions much as an outreach program, operating primarily in areas where Vadalis does not have official house enclaves. The guild serves to gather independent ranchers and breeders, share information and bloodlines, and sell Vadalis methods and training to those who want to improve their own herds through nonmagical means. In addition, the guild licenses the teamsters, drovers, stablehands, and handlers that comprise the most common face of the house in Khorvaire.</p><p>The Handlers Guild provides certification for its members, allowing them to find work with wealthy patrons who need their lands and livestock managed. It also deals with business the house does outside the Eldeen Reaches. It has almost no enclaves or outposts, its members instead meeting up wherever their travels happen to take them. Some have noted that such a fluid presence would make an excellent front for any number of sinister causes, but no evidence of such activity in Vadalis has ever been found.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":700000,"name":"The Mark of Healing","type":"text","_id":"DlP3a7zY02crlU7S","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<img src=\"modules/pf2e-for-eberron/images/MarkOfHealing.png\" class=\" centered\" width=\"131\" height=\"142\" /><blockquote><p>A halfling with the Mark of Healing can save a life with a touch, restoring vitality and the will to live.

Well, I’ve got a rate sheet right over here. I’d be happy to discuss it.</p><p>-Bessi d’Jorasco, Fairhaven healer</p></blockquote><p>Leader: Ulara d’Jorasco<br />Headquarters: Vedkyar Enclave (Vedykar, Karrnath)</p><p>The halflings of House Jorasco hold the Mark of Healing, and their good works have saved countless lives. They heal the sick and the dying, and provide comfort and respite for those whom even magic cannot cure. They often work hand in hand with House Ghallanda, giving travelers access to healing and aid even in remote areas. By those who owe their health or life to the Mark of Healing, Jorasco’s name is praised.</p><p>At the same time, Jorasco is not a charity institution. As a dragonmarked house, it is an economic stronghold of epic proportions, offering its services to all who need them—and are able to pay. This mercenary approach to succor rubs many people the wrong way, however, particularly the poor and indigent who cannot afford a healer’s services regardless of need.</p><h2>Worlds Apart</h2><p>Like its sibling House Ghallanda, House Jorasco was born on the Talenta Plains. Unlike the Ghallanda halflings, House Jorasco long ago shifted its focus from the ways of tribal life to the cosmopolitan traditions of central Khorvaire. Today, Jorasco halflings have little or no connection to the ways of their nomadic ancestors, and are firmly entrenched in the lifestyle of the Five Nations.</p><p>House Jorasco has long been established as the preeminent source of healing in Khorvaire, having skillfully pushed the temples of the Sovereign Host and the Silver Flame out of the healing business centuries ago. The advent of the Last War saw Jorasco healers spread across the length and breadth of the continent. Remaining steadfastly neutral allowed the house to serve all sides in that conflict, providing mundane care for soldiers and magical healing for the officers who directed the war. Jorasco healers assisted in important military operations and engaged in joint missions with House Ghallanda, offering respite and healing for the wounded—away from the front lines.</p><p>Even after the Last War’s end, Jorasco still reaps the benefits of that dark conflict. Those who were broken in battle require a lifetime’s care now that the war is over—and such care is House Jorasco’s specialty. Since the end of the war, the house has expanded the number of enclaves and healing houses it runs by nearly a third, including opening state-financed centers for veterans of the Last War in each nation.</p><h2>The Price of Healing</h2><p>Initially, House Jorasco was the Jorasco tribe, a collection of related family lines. Eschewing the battle-hardened traditions of the Talenta tribes, Jorasco halflings earned their keep through their skills at healing: from midwifery, to patching up wounded warriors, to helping ease the dying along their way. Their skill would be paid for by the recovering individual’s family or tribe, an exchange of gifts and services that was the expected convention of Talenta culture.</p><p>When the tribe became a house, the dynamic changed. In founding the house and establishing its headquarters in Karrnath, Jorasco soon found itself in debt to House Cannith and House Sivis—debt that called for Jorasco’s services to be repaid in coin, not kind. In time, the healers of Jorasco were operating on a set schedule of fees and asking for payment in advance.</p><p>This initial fee schedule was designed to support the healers of Jorasco in return for the time they spent caring for others. As the house became more successful, however, payment became less about survival and more about profit. The Korth Edicts codified this situation in a way, preventing the houses from owning land and forcing them to focus their fortunes in gold alone. Since that time, Jorasco’s mission of healing has always been balanced by the house’s passion for profit, a reality that angers those most in need of Jorasco’s gifts.</p><h2>House Jorasco in the World</h2><p>Inevitably, adventurers get hurt. When they do, they almost as inevitably seek a healer of House Jorasco. Even in a group that includes a cleric, PCs often come up against diseases, curses, and mortal wounds beyond the ability of low-level healers to remedy. In such situations, Jorasco is always waiting with open arms—and an eye to its purse. Officially, House Jorasco never accepts services in kind, but for adventurers who cannot afford to pay, the house will sometimes “loan” the required fee and set an exchange of services as repayment.</p><p>Service to a Jorasco healer might involve retrieving a certain medicinal herb from the Shadow Marches, seeking out a beholder’s tongue for a rare alchemical cure, or helping to keep anyone from entering or leaving a quarantined village. In many cases, making good on their debt might well place the PCs in need of a healer again.</p><p>House Jorasco was originally a tribe of Talenta halflings renowned for its steadfast nature and healing gifts. With the appearance of the Mark of Healing (and the subsequent appearance of emissaries from House Cannith and House Sivis to explain its significance), the Jorasco halflings accepted that their fate was larger than the plains of their birth. When House Jorasco settled in Karrnath and the lands beyond, the halflings gave up their nomadic ways.</p><p>The legacy of the plains lives on only in the house’s leadership structure, which bears little more than a superficial resemblance to the other dragonmarked houses. Groups within the house remain structured along family lines. Ulara d’Jorasco rules the house as matriarch, but all house members hold the right to advise the leadership as they see fit. The matriarch is chosen by the house membership and directs the activities of the house until she dies or loses the respect and confidence of the house. As a result, Jorasco changes leadership more often than any other house, but such changes have yet to disrupt the house’s operations. Ulara spends almost all her time at the Jorasco enclave in Vedykar, and is greatly beloved by her house. </p><h2>House Jorasco's Holdings</h2><p>Though House Jorasco’s healing touch can be found across Khorvaire, the house’s main seat of power is the city of Vedykar, in Karrnath. The enclave there is known within the house as Resthold, and is the home of the matriarch, Ulara d’Jorasco.</p><p>Within Resthold, one can find the finest healing facilities in all Khorvaire, in addition to a training hospital, a spa for long-term convalescence, and an asylum for those who suffer from madness even magic cannot cure. Desperate individuals have been known to cross Khorvaire to seek help there; it is said that if you cannot be cured in Resthold, then nothing can save you.</p><p>Aside from Vedykar, Jorasco maintains large healing enclaves in Fair haven, Sharn, and Gatherhold in the Talenta Plains. The house also has holdings and Healers Guild facilities in Flamekeep, Korth, Newthrone, Taer Valaestas, Trolanport, Pylas Talaear, and Stormreach, in addition to small offices and clinics across Khorvaire.</p><h2>Guilds of House Jorasco</h2><p>While the Healers Guild and House Jorasco are technically separate entities, the house’s single-minded focus on healing makes it difficult to tell where one ends and the other begins.</p><h3>Healers Guild</h3><p>The Healers Guild operates healing enclaves, hospitals, and way stops across Khorvaire and beyond. All members of the house, from fostered children to dragonmarked heirs, are taught the ways of healing. Herbalism, alchemy, and use of the Heal skill are the foundations of house life and learning, and house members are expected to serve in the guild throughout their careers. Even the house patriarch undertakes a token period of service in a guild hospital each year.</p><p> </p><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":800000,"name":"The Mark of Hospitality","type":"text","_id":"LpSfsRN12h0iloaQ","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<img src=\"modules/pf2e-for-eberron/images/MarkOfHospitality.png\" class=\" centered\" width=\"131\" height=\"142\" /><blockquote><p>They may not always have gold, but a halfling with the Mark of Hospitality is sure to be rich in friends.

So good to see you again. Let me get your drink—blackroot tal with honey, yes? And then you have to listen to this story I’ve heard about the strange things going on in the Cogs.</p><p>—Alara d’Ghallanda, halfling bartender</p></blockquote><p>Leader: Yoren d’Ghallanda<br />Headquarters: Gatherhold (Talenta Plains)</p><p>Fine food, a comfortable chair, a mug of ale, and a roaring fi re: These are the treasures of House Ghallanda. The blink dog seal of the house is a beacon for the weary traveler. When stamped on the trade sign of an inn or tavern, it promises reliable service and reasonable rates—but there might be more to this simple inn than meets the eye. House Ghallanda goes to great lengths to form bonds within local communities, and Ghallanda heirs take pride in being able to acquire special services for valued clients. The Ghallanda innkeeper is not a spy, nor does he solve crimes. He knows the word on the street, though, and if you’re looking for tickets to the Sharn Opera, a discreet bordello, or a trustworthy diviner, he can help you.</p><p>Though Ghallanda is known for its inns, the house has other holdings. Ghallanda landlords offer long term housing, and the master chefs of the house prepare meals for kings and queens. The wealthy of Khorvaire vacation at Ghallanda resorts and gambling halls, while house decorators have helped to establish the aesthetic of the modern age. The heirs of House Ghallanda might not be as impressive as the arcanists of House Cannith or the warriors of Deneith, but it is dangerous to underestimate the power of this house. After all, many an adventurer feels more loyalty to his bartender than to his king.</p><h2>The Sign of the Helpful Hound</h2><p>The Mark of Hospitality manifested among the nomadic halflings of the Talenta Plains approximately thirty-two hundred years ago. For those accustomed to the hard life of the plains, the powers of the mark were a boon. The halflings knew nothing of the draconic Prophecy, concluding instead that the marks were a divine blessing, and that those so blessed were obliged to use this gift to help others in need. The majority of marked halflings chose to follow this call, coming together to form a new tribe. A number of ancient Talenta legends involved blink dogs helping stranded travelers, and the tribe drew on this tradition when they adopted the name of Ghallanda, a Halfling word that roughly translates as “helpful hound who appears where needed the most.”</p><p>For centuries, halflings of the Ghallanda tribe roamed the Talenta Plains, offering food and shelter to the needy. They sponsored glorious feasts for the heroes of the plains, standing apart from feuds and tribal conflicts. The helpful hounds were welcome in every camp and assisted people of all tribes.</p><h2>The Rise of House Ghallanda</h2><p>Karrn soldiers first explored the Talenta Plains when Karrn the Conqueror sought to spread his rule across all Khorvaire. The Talenta halflings were puzzled by these large and unwieldy creatures, but the Ghallanda tribe had vowed to help all who were in need. Soldiers returned with tales of little people using magical marks to conjure food and castles from the air. These tales intrigued the other dragonmarked families, and House Cannith and House Sivis organized a joint expedition that led them to discover both the Ghallanda and Jorasco dragonmarked.</p><p>Despite their altruistic traditions, the elders of the Ghallanda were no fools. Even those who desired to leave the plains and explore foreign lands did not intend to do so as servants. They agreed to work with the other houses, provided those houses would help them find a foothold in their lands. After much negotiating, House Ghallanda was born.</p><h2>Ghallanda in the Modern Age</h2><p>It took some time for House Ghallanda to spread its roots. Many humans considered the halflings to be cousins to the goblins, who were largely oppressed and enslaved at the time. The Ghallanda halflings had often served as mediators in their homelands, and they used their skill and charm at every level of society as they carved out a niche in the young Five Nations. During the conflict of the War of the Mark, the Ghallanda halflings proved their worth by supplying and supporting dragonmarked forces in the field. This effort gained them the support of the other houses and secured their place among the Twelve.</p><p>Over the next thousand years, House Ghallanda spread across Khorvaire, and today it is one of the most trusted houses in the land. Though some claim that House Cannith caused the Day of Mourning, or blame House Deneith for the Darguun uprising, few people have harsh words for the halflings of Ghallanda—at least as long as the ale is fl owing.</p><h2>House Ghallanda in the World</h2><p>House Ghallanda is one of the most widespread dragonmarked houses. It maintains enclaves, but not on the scale of a massive Cannith forgehold or one of the Phiarlan demesnes. Instead, its families are spread across hundreds of inns and hostels, any of which can serve as a temporary shelter for a wandering heir. More than any other house, Ghallanda is a ubiquitous presence in the world. Even if a village doesn’t have a tavern run by an actual Ghallanda heir, there’s a decent chance it has a Ghallanda-licensed inn or hostel, even in Darguun or Droaam. Adventurers who build a relationship with the house can find allies across Khorvaire, while those who offend an innkeeper do so at their peril. A Ghallanda bartender might not pose a physical threat, but the conversations he has heard and the friends he has made give him far more influence than an adventurer might expect.</p><p>When Ghallanda spread to civilized lands, it adopted the dragonmarked hierarchy established by House Sivis and House Cannith. Every region is governed by a council of viceroys, and Patriarch Yoren d’Ghallanda leads the house from Gatherhold in the Talenta Plains. One of the oddities of the house is that viceroys often maintain businesses of their own. Yoren himself is a master chef, and spends almost as much time in the kitchens of his great hall as he does in the council chambers.</p><p>On the Plains, an older hierarchy endures in the form of the Wandering Inn. The Ghallanda halflings who make up this traveling fair follow the ways of their tribal ancestors, providing a nomadic place of refuge for the Talenta halflings living outside Gatherhold’s walls. Though the Wandering Inn seldom leaves the plains, small splinter groups carrying on its traditions have been encountered in Q’barra and Valenar in recent years. Tales are even told of weary adventurers fleeing the Mournland who have stumbled upon a bright wagon of the Wandering Inn and the safety of a Mordenkainen’s magnificent mansion inside.</p><p>The Wandering Inn is largely isolated from the main house. The halflings of the inn abhor the idea of settling in cities, while house heirs outside the plains often consider the life of the Inn to be rough and uncivilized. Young halflings are sometimes drawn to explore the path on the opposite side of the house, though, and these ambassadors keep the bonds between the Inn and the main house strong.</p><p>Ghallanda halflings have never bothered with family names. Though the original Ghallanda tribe was formed from dozens of different families, the names of these original tribes were abandoned within a generation of the Mark of Hospitality’s fi rst appearance.</p><h2>House Ghallanda's Holdings</h2><p>House Ghallanda’s oldest and most important enclave is the great hall of Gatherhold, on the edge of the Talenta Plains. Located on the eastern shore of Lake Cyre, this area has long been a border between the Five Nations and the eastern wilds. In the aftermath of the Day of Mourning, the hall became a haven for the adventurers and scholars exploring the eastern Mournland.</p><p>Gatherhold is an ancient cliff dwelling, filled with tunnels and warrens carved into the rocky hills that run along the lake. Patriarch Yoren presides over a great hall at the center of the town, but House Ghallanda maintains the entire community for the nomadic tribes who come and go with the seasons.</p><h2>Guilds of House Ghallanda</h2><p>The Ghallanda seal is a promise of quality, and guild inspectors ensure that licensed and bound businesses maintain the standards of the house.</p><h3>Hostelers Guild</h3><p>The Hostelers Guild encompasses all aspects of the hospitality industry, from food to lodging and legal gambling.

Orien may drive the lightning rail, but it’s Cannith who builds the cars and lays the stones it travels on. Cannith makes the everbright lanterns hold the night at bay. Smith, carpenter, alchemist—the best all carry my seal.</p><p>—Baron Merrix d’Cannith</p></blockquote><p>Cannith East<br />Leader: Zorlan d’Cannith<br />Headquarters: Korth Enclave (Karrnath)<br /></p><p>Cannith West<br />Leader: Jorlanna d’Cannith<br />Headquarters: Aundair Enclave (near Fairhaven, Aundair)</p><p>Cannith South<br />Leader: Merrix d’Cannith<br />Headquarters: Cannith Tower (Sharn, Breland)</p><p>From a few bands of roving artisans and tinkers, House Cannith has risen to dominate commerce and industry in Khorvaire. For every advance made in magic, odds are good that Cannith had a hand in it—from everbright lanterns to the lightning rail, from the warforged to the secret experiments now lost deep within the wastes of the Mournland.</p><p>With its power and creative genius, the house commands both respect and fear. Despite its accomplishments, however, Cannith stands in turmoil. Unable to agree on a new ruler in the aftermath of the Day of Mourning, the house splintered into three factions, each with its own agenda. This rift has caused unease among the houses and beyond, giving monarchs and entrepreneurs pause even as they cautiously back one of three would-be leaders.</p><h2>Makers of History</h2><p>Since its incorporation prior to the War of the Mark, House Cannith has been a leader among the dragonmarked houses. It pioneered the marriage of magic to the needs of daily life, and members of the house are the foremost experts on the use of dragonshards. Along with the gnomes of Zilargo, the house created the elemental ships that cross the seas. In partnership with House Orien, it forged the lightning rail that once spanned Khorvaire.</p><p>Cannith’s most indelible mark on history was made in 965 YK with the creation of the warforged. The mastermind behind the warforged was Merrix d’Cannith, who set out to create a sentient construct that could fight in place of living creatures. First commissioned by King Jarot, the last king of Galifar, the warforged instead went to battle on behalf of his children during the Last War.</p><p>Merrix’s son Aarren gave sentience to these living constructs. For thirty years, the sale of warforged kept Cannith prosperous, with each of the Five Nations commissioning troops from Whitehearth, Cannith’s ancestral forgehold. The house seemed destined to prosper as the Last War dragged on. Then came the Day of Mourning.</p><h2>Paradise Lost</h2><p>On the Day of Mourning, a blast of arcane power obliterated Cyre, leaving empty wasteland. Most Cyrans perished that day, including the patriarch of House Cannith: Baron Starrin d’Cannith, known as “the Gorgon” for both his intimidating manner and the symbol of his house.</p><p>What caused the Day of Mourning, none can say. It seems that of the cities of Cyre, Eston suffered the greatest damage. Whitehearth’s destruction claimed the life of not only the baron, but also many of the house’s prominent leaders and dragonmarked heirs.</p><p>Almost as great as the loss in blood was the loss of the forgehold itself. Whitehearth had been the center of Cannith ingenuity and invention for centuries. Only projects concurrently researched in Sharn by Merrix d’Cannith, grandson of the first Merrix, survived. Whitehearth is never far from the minds of House Cannith’s leaders, with Merrix in particular striving for its recovery. Increasingly, though, the cost associated with that recovery effort has exacerbated the rift within the house. Some seek to resurrect Whitehearth one day; others wish to turn their backs on the tomb of the past and focus instead on the future.</p><h2>The Treaty of Thronehold</h2><p>Two years after the loss of Cyre, the Treaty of Thronehold was signed, putting an end to both the war and the nation of Galifar. No one profits during war like a weaponsmith, and no one suffers as much from war’s end.</p><p>For House Cannith, the treaty brought more than the end of a profitable market: The signatory nations recognized the warforged as a free people, due the same rights as other sentient races. The treaty also forbade Cannith from creating more warforged, ensuring that the house’s crowning achievement would be remembered as little more than a bloody postscript to past glory.</p><p>Having no choice but to agree to the treaty’s terms, the heads of the fractured house returned to their respective homes, plotting in silence while they went through the motions of retooling House Cannith for peace. Merrix, however, never intended to let his grandfather’s legacy pass away. His stronghold in Sharn holds a secret creation forge, known only to the sworn heirs of his line.</p><p>Today, those who gain entry to the Sharn forgehold see significantly newer warforged. Unaware of their rights as sentient beings, these warforged serve the artificers, who seek the next evolution of design. This secret rebellion leads Cannith along a dangerous path. Should Merrix’s deception be discovered, Breland and the other nations will have to enforce the treaty—even if it means striking the blow that shatters House Cannith for all time.</p><h2>The Three Headed Gorgon</h2><p>When Starrin d’Cannith died, he left no direct heir or immediate relations, but it did not take long for claimants to the house leadership to appear. Typically, upon the death of the patriarch, the title goes to either his closest living relative or his named successor. Starrin’s named successor was his only son Norran, who died with his father in Cyre and left no children of his own.</p><p>When succession becomes murky, the elders of the house interpret the will of the former patriarch and choose a successor. However, with the ranks of the house leadership decimated, no effective or fair vote could be held. Cannith was paralyzed, with three heirs emerging to claim leadership: Merrix d’Cannith, Jorlanna d’Cannith, and Zorlan d’Cannith. Though each had a valid claim to the patriarch’s seat, a more problematic set of candidates would be hard to find.</p><p>Merrix is the grandson of the first Merrix, the son of Aarren d’Cannith, and the former patriarch’s grandnephew. The youngest candidate, he was little more than a baby when the warforged were invented. His age and lack of political expertise give him the weakest claim, but his inheritance of Merrix’s legendary skills in research and innovation forces his relatives to take him seriously. He wishes only to pursue his secret experiments in peace, but knowing Jorlanna and Zorlan, he is convinced that a firm hand will be required to keep House Cannith on course—not necessarily his hand, but one of his choosing.</p><p>Jorlanna d’Cannith is a proud, attractive woman in her fifties. She is far closer to the age of a proper matriarch than Merrix. Her claim is stronger too, as the daughter of Starrin’s second wife, Elsabet. Regardless, Jorlanna is considered least likely to attain the title. She has a strong vision for a united house, allies among the Twelve, and the personal magnetism to lead, but the Cannith elders distrust her judgment. In her youth, Jorlanna engaged in a scandalous romance with an heir of House Deneith. Both families put a stop to it once they became aware of the relationship, and the lovers disappeared from public view for over a year. It was rumored that Jorlanna bore a child during her time away—product of a coupling forbidden after the War of the Mark. However, when she finally resumed public life, she did so alone. Today, whispered rumors of her indiscretion haunt her, and critics use them as proof of her lack of judgment where the good of the house is concerned.</p><p>Zorlan d’Cannith is a distinguished, shrewd scion of the house. His talent with finance and eye for profit made him a trusted advisor to the Gorgon, whose cousin, Xerith, was Zorlan’s mother. Zorlan’s gifts are countered by a cold, cruel personality that unnerves many within the house. His time in Karrnath is rumored to have drawn him into the customs of that land, including worship of the Blood of Vol. Some fear that Zorlan’s ambition could lead him to make pacts with dishonorable groups. Merrix, Jorlanna, and Zorlan are each determined to become the next leader of House Cannith. Between them, they have divided the lords seneschal so evenly that a new patriarch will likely never be chosen. As it stands, the divided leadership makes it increasingly likely that only death or disaster will change the balance of power.</p><h3>Cannith South</h3><p>Under Merrix d’Cannith, Cannith South is considered by many to be the closest replacement for Whitehearth the house will ever see. With his enclave concealing the last Cannith creation forge, Merrix rules his house’s southern interests (including expeditions to Xen’drik and the Mournland) with an iron fist.</p><p>Cannith South workshops and enclaves dot Breland, Zilargo, and even Darguun, making Merrix the most expansion-minded leader House Cannith has seen in an age. Some say he plans to open facilities in Xen’drik to support his expeditions and interests there. Though Cannith South denies these plans, house members regard such moves as all but certain. Merrix has already secured holdings to expand the enclave in Stormreach. Only Merrix himself knows that he plans not just a workshop, but a second Cannith creation forge—outside Khorvaire, where the Treaty of Thronehold has no sway. The heirs of Cannith South are driven to achieve— advancement is dependent on how closely one’s ideals and ambitions match those of Merrix. Worship of the Traveler in his artificer aspect has taken a slow hold among the members of Cannith South. This affiliation with one of the Dark Six troubles members of Cannith West in particular, but Merrix shows no sign of sharing their concern.</p><h3>Cannith West</h3><p>The relationship between Aundair and Cyre was close during the Last War. When Jorlanna d’Cannith was sent away in disgrace, she went to Aundair, living there in seclusion for a year. Even after her exile ended, she soon returned to hone her diplomatic talents. Jorlanna negotiated house access to the Eldeen Reaches through the Wardens of the Wood, allowing Cannith sages to study ruins and magical locales under the druids’ supervision.</p><p>Members of Cannith West are expected to be socially adept. In Aundair, they engage in scholarly pursuits, especially those connected to magical sites in western Khorvaire. They have more contact with other dragonmarked houses and local nobility than other Cannith branches do. Jorlanna plans to rebuild the goodwill of the Five Nations toward the house and make a greater investment in the Twelve, with hopes of seeing it regain its power. Since the Twelve is headquartered in Korth, it vexes Zorlan that Jorlanna’s status within the organization exceeds his.</p><p>Both Zorlan and Merrix remain unaware that Jorlanna’s romantic indiscretions are not entirely behind her. For a year now, Jorlanna has been clandestinely involved with a young scion of House Orien—never realizing that her lover is actually a rakshasa agent of the Lords of Dust. The fiend’s immediate goal is to fracture House Cannith permanently, and he manipulates Jorlanna to that end.</p><h3>Cannith East</h3><p>Though Zorlan grew up in Cyre, he traveled to Karrnath as a house emissary along with the first warforged ordered by that nation. He took up residence there, advising Kaius II and strengthening his house’s influence. He used profitable arrangements with the Mror Holds and the Lhazaar Principalities to fill his coffers and make himself an advisor to the Gorgon.</p><p>Where Cannith once had only an outpost in Karrnath, Zorlan’s leadership has seen the house’s wealth and prestige there grow. Before the Day of Mourning, many Cannith heirs were sent to Karrnath to study administration and diplomacy, and to receive martial instruction from Rekkenmark Academy. This training ended with the fracture of the Cannith leadership, but many heirs still proudly recall their “Karrnath years.” Though the steady stream of warforged into Karrnath has ceased, Cannith East still has expertise in siege warfare, and house members serve as advisors to Karrn generals.</p><p>The Karrnathi culture has left its mark on Cannith East. Members take a callous view of mortality, viewing the undead as little more than the necromantic equivalent of warforged. Though invention is Cannith East’s strength, clandestine research at its enclave seeks to create a new form of construct undead, animated with eldritch power and a bound, ghostly intelligence.</p><p>Living among the Karrns has led many of Cannith to worship the Blood of Vol. Though Cannith would never openly declare allegiance to any other power group, nearly half the members of the Karrnathi enclave are said to follow that faith. Zorlan is a devout member, even aspiring to a position in the cult’s lay clergy and personally conducting services for house members on special occasions. </p><h2>House Cannith in the World</h2><p>Wherever magical power can be gained, House Cannith is nearby. Not content to let the Twelve do their work for them, the scions of the house claim any resource that might help them regain their former glory or exceed their previous achievements—as quietly as possible, of course. Though the house is not wholly evil, many within Cannith can hardly be called souls of truth and righteousness. As a base of operations for the PCs, a bastion against truly dark forces in the world, or an evil empire, House Cannith can be a powerful force in any campaign.</p><p>The last patriarch, Starrin d’Cannith, left a lasting imprint on his house. Though Merrix and Aarren created the warforged, Starrin engaged the warring sibling kings of the Five Nations, persuading them both of Cannith’s neutrality and of the warforged’s usefulness in battle. His death was a blow from which the house has yet to recover.</p><p>Instead of a single patriarch, Cannith currently has three descendants claiming the title of baron, each managing a portion of the house’s concerns. Though a council of lords seneschal would typically reign over the viceroys, Merrix, Jorlanna, and Zorlan’s nominal status as the heirs to the seat of the Gorgon effectively makes them a triumvirate, over which the lords seneschal have little control.</p><p>Promotion within the house is judged by one’s contributions to Cannith’s continued growth and well-being. Members must strive if they wish to become more powerful within the hierarchy. Those who succeed are either brilliant at invention, uncannily aware of others’ motives, or both. House members with no taste for politics succeed by lending their support to those so inclined.</p><h2>House Cannith's Holdings</h2><p>Though Cannith lost Whitehearth, Merrix d’Cannith’s enclave in Sharn has taken over the house’s creative work. The Sharn enclave is the practical headquarters for the business of the house, but those with political or investment interests more often approach Jorlanna or Zorlan.</p><p>Many look to Sharn for new wonders, but Cannith is not limited to one facility. The house has holdings across the continent, and beyond. Though Sharn has the only current forgehold, Cannith estates are found in Fairhaven, Flamekeep, Korth, Throneport, and Trolanport, with small outposts at Regalport and Varna. Abroad, the house has holdings in Pylas Talaear on Aerenal and in Stormreach on Xen’drik. The Tinkers Guild and Fabricators Guild are found in every major city in the Five Nations, and in larger centers in the lands beyond.</p><h2>Guilds of House Cannith</h2><p>The roots of House Cannith are in its guilds, the historical face of the house and the most common Cannith presence outside its enclaves. The bulk of house business actually goes on outside the guilds, which are seen by house members as only training grounds or career footnotes.</p><h3>Fabricators Guild</h3><p>The Fabricators Guild is a mercantile branch of House Cannith, well known as a training ground for arcane spellcasters and dragonmarked heirs. Outside the house, the Fabricators Guild has a reputation for fi ne, reliable goods. Guild shops offer a complete range of mundane equipment, and some accept commissions for unusual nonmagical items. Though most guild members keep to cities, some heirs are commissioned to travel with caravans and ships, to create or repair equipment.</p><h3>Tinkers Guild</h3><p>The Tinkers Guild is a mercantile branch of House Cannith, and hearkens back to the origins of the house. Cannith was born from groups of human tinkers that moved from town to town, repairing broken items or making new ones to sell. The guild has a virtual monopoly on the repair of mundane objects, primarily by members with the least or lesser Marks of Making. Most Dragonmarked heirs of Cannith serve at least two years in the guild, acting as the public face of the house in Khorvaire. Those dragonmarked who decide that rank and power are not for them sometimes remain in the guild, balancing a lack of respect from others in the house with a life of relative freedom.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1150000,"name":"The Mark of Passage","type":"text","_id":"YMzO1WqEOXvkndJ4","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<img src=\"modules/pf2e-for-eberron/images/MarkOfPassage.png\" class=\" centered\" width=\"131\" height=\"142\" /><blockquote><p>The Mark of Passage governs motion, allowing its bearer to move with uncanny speed.

It doesn’t matter if it’s a letter, a person, or a hundred tons of steel. Whether we have to cross mountains, rivers, or the Mournland itself, Orien finds a way.</p><p>—Bali d’Orien, veteran courier</p></blockquote><p>Leader: Kwanti d’Orien<br />Headquarters: Journey’s Home (Passage, Aundair)<br /></p><p>The house of transport and transit, Orien is a name known across Khorvaire. No other house directly touches as many lives, whether through the lightning rail that once connected the great cities of the Five Nations, the caravans that traverse rural lands, or the couriers who deliver letters and packages virtually anywhere.</p><p>House Orien’s businesses have been pervasive (and profitable) since before the first appearance of the Mark of Passage. However, the Last War took a heavy toll on this house—one from which it has yet to recover. After decades of effort, House Orien had spanned the Five Nations with its lightning rail, but the war and the Day of Mourning shattered the house’s intercontinental links. Today, the organization is bent on recovery, but fresh competition from House Lyrandar and the instability of Khorvaire’s new age are challenges the house has yet to overcome.</p><h1>By Road and Rail</h1><p>House Orien began as a collection of merchants and teamsters, forming caravans that moved around pre-Galifar Aundair and beyond. They manifested the Mark of Passage nineteen hundred years ago, enhancing their skills with supernatural abilities that swiftly allowed them to dominate the roads of central Khorvaire. The dragonmarks were a celebrated phenomenon by this point, and the extended Orien family established itself as a dragonmarked house in short order.</p><p>In the days before Galifar, few except the couriers and caravans of House Orien could cross the boundaries of nations and the holds of minor warlords in safety. With the help of the Mark of Passage and a knack for diplomacy, it became possible for Orien messengers to send information and packages from one end of Khorvaire to the other, with an excellent probability that the goods would arrive intact and in time. Orien caravans also carried human cargo, and as workers and explorers moved across the continent, the house became one of the primary forces driving the commonality of culture that marks Khorvaire today.</p><p>Even as Orien’s mundane transportation services connected the Khorvaire of the common folk, the Mark of Passage provided the house with services so exclusive—and so expensive—that few but kings and queens could afford them. In a united Galifar, nobles who might once have fought each other were forced to curry diplomatic favor and entertain their peers at court. However, the vastness of Khorvaire (not to mention the land’s many dangers) made mundane travel for a royal retinue impractical at best. As such, the teleport ability of the greater Mark of Passage quickly became Orien’s most requested (and most profitable) service. Effortless and instantaneous travel between the courts of Galifar helped establish the foundation of communication and trust among the nobility that allowed the new kingdom to thrive.</p><p>As its routes stabilized and Galifar grew, Orien took on a royal commission that seemed like little more than a dream at the time: to connect Galifar’s cities with highspeed transport that would allow travel across the kingdom in a matter of days. In 811 YK, the fi rst lightning rail line was established between Fairhaven and Flamekeep. In 845 YK, King Jarot announced his intention to see the lightning rail connect every corner of Galifar, a task that Orien completed in less than twenty years.</p><p>With lines of conductor stones spanning the Five Nations, Orien controlled three crown-subsidized lightning rail routes, all running through the heart of the nation in Cyre. From its humble origins on the trails and trade roads of Aundair, Orien had grown to the house that held a kingdom together.</p><h1>Dark Path Ahead</h1><p>What Orien had built over a lifetime, the Last War shattered in two terrible events. The fi rst of these was in 899 YK, when the White Arch Bridge across Scions Sound was destroyed, most likely by order of King Kaius I. The bridge, which connected the city of Rekkenmark in Karrnath with Thaliost in Thrane, was an indefensible liability for both nations, but when it fell, Orien’s primary east–west link across Khorvaire fell with it. In the aftermath of the war, many have spoken of the need to rebuild the bridge. However, Orien cannot afford the expense of reconstruction, and Thrane and Karrnath have little reason to want their kingdoms linked across the sound once more.</p><p>The second and more devastating loss happened on the Day of Mourning. Orien’s three routes met at Metrol, the crossroads of Khorvaire, which was destroyed in the cataclysm that razed Cyre. Orien still maintains that the Cyre lines are intact, but the house has yet to send a commercial coach into the Mournland. Reports from explorers in that wasted land hint that many conductor stones have been stolen, leaving gaps large enough to derail a coach.</p><p>Since the war’s end, Orien has managed to go some distance toward offsetting the loss of its profitable lightning rail runs with its other courier and transport services. At the same time, the viceroys of the house are determined to reclaim their former wealth and status, but they know that doing so will require allies. The Five Nations might never again be one, but the house hopes that the leaders of those nations can be convinced of the need to reforge links to each other’s lands.</p><h1>House Orien in the World</h1><p>House Orien is synonymous with travel across Khorvaire. House Lyrandar commands the air, but their ports of call are limited compared to Orien’s. If travel is important in a campaign, little work needs to be done to bring Orien into it. Whether a journey by caravan or lightning rail is simply a means to get to adventure or an adventure in and of itself, the adventurers will become familiar with (if not employed by) House Orien before they reach their destination.</p><p>Orien caravans are the cheapest and often most dependable means of travel for adventurers. Even those with the wealth to afford the lightning rail or airship travel soon discover many destinations in Khorvaire that only caravans or coaches can reach.</p><p>Though House Orien follows the standard hierarchy of the dragonmarked houses, significant differences exist at the top levels. On the patriarch’s council, each guild has three representatives (two elected by guild members, one appointed by the guild-master) while the house has another three representatives appointed by the patriarch. Protocol is firmly followed at the higher levels. Decisions are rarely made without a quorum present, and a two-thirds majority vote is required for most resolutions. The patriarch almost never makes a decision alone, but presents issues to his council and casts the deciding vote when necessary. It is no surprise, then, that the other houses look at Orien and wonder who is in charge.</p><p>Among the middle to lower ranks of the house, the full acceptance of children born out of wedlock (and half-breed children at that) throws a twist into the traditional dragonmarked sense of aristocracy. Birth order and blood ties to the house are the primary determination of social status. Within the guilds, more upward mobility is possible, since family ties are less important.</p><p>The current patriarch of the house is Baron Kwanti d’Orien. Though the house enclave in Passage is his primary residence, he spends much of his time on a private lightning rail coach, checking up on enclaves and stations throughout the Five Nations. His current goal is to fi nd a source of income to allow Orien to reroute the broken lightning rail around the Mournland.</p><h1>House Orien's Holdings</h1><p>The families that made up House Orien were originally spread across Aundair, but their transformation into a dragonmarked house created the need for a home. They chose a small town that they renamed Passage, building their main enclave and headquarters there. This they called “Journey’s Home,” in reference to the amount of time most house heirs would be away from it.</p><p>Journey’s Home takes up roughly one-third of the modern city of Passage. It employs nearly half the city’s workforce in one capacity or another, with a considerable number devoted to the construction and maintenance of lightning rail carts and caravan wagons. Research into new magical methods of transport and shipping is centered at Journey’s Home, and most spellcasting heirs make their homes there.</p><p>All members of House Orien are expected to spend time at Journey’s Home, learning the behind-the-scenes aspects of running the house and guilds as they keep up with the industry Orien has created. Guild hirelings might visit on occasion, but such trips are rare, and usually presage advancement or individual honor.</p><p>In addition to Journey’s Home, House Orien keeps enclaves in Sharn, New Cyre, Varna, Korth, Regalport, Krona Peak, Flamekeep, Taer Valaestas, and Trolanport. The house also has outposts and offices in nearly every town on the trade roads and lightning rail routes of the Five Nations and beyond. Most of these offer the services of one or both guilds. Aside from House Vadalis, Orien is the only dragonmarked house to have a significant presence in the Eldeen Reaches.</p><p>House Orien maintains a number of lightning rail coaches that act as mobile enclaves for important house members. Used exclusively for house and guild business, these coaches are not held to any timetable, and are given priority on the lightning rail lines over commercial and private coaches alike.</p><h1>Guilds of House Orien</h1><p>The day-to-day issues of coordinating lightning rail traffic, hiring and paying caravan crews, and overseeing the movement of goods and passengers are handled by the Couriers Guild and the Transportation Guild. The house acts as a managing company, keeping its share of the profits and overseeing the guilds’ decision-making processes. Most members of House Orien work for one guild or the other. Non-guild members of the house typically deal with the other houses or the governments of Khorvaire.</p><h2>Couriers Guild</h2><p>The Couriers Guild serves both the rich and poor of Khorvaire, though the common folk arguably benefit the most from it. For a reasonable fee, the guild arranges safe transportation for letters or packages. Lightning rail cargo runs cover Khorvaire’s major centers and the smaller settlements enroute, while Orien caravans serve more remote areas. In addition, the Couriers Guild can arrange express shipping, guaranteeing the fastest service and personal delivery at the recipient’s end. For its most exclusive clients (and at its most expensive rates), the guild guarantees safe, next-day delivery of any parcel small enough to be carried by the courier charged with teleporting to its destination.</p><p>As a side service, the guild also employs an elite group of agents who specialize in secure and high-risk delivery scenarios. If the destination is dangerous or remote, or if the item or information to be shipped cannot be entrusted to the rail or the open road, the Couriers Guild has options for those who can afford them.</p><p>Couriers typically undertake a good number of low-risk assignments before they are entrusted with sensitive documents or goods. All couriers undergo a thorough investigation of their character before becoming members of the guild. Those who have proven their worth and are of sufficient experience can become special couriers, taking on high-profile assignments.</p><h2>Transportation Guild</h2><p>The Transportation Guild is responsible for lightning rail, caravan, and coach routes throughout Khorvaire, including the maintenance of trade roads and courier posts. Tariff agreements made with the nations through which its lines run fund the guild. Taxes paid by the settlements where stops are located go toward station maintenance. Passenger fares and shipping fees on the lightning rail, coaches, and caravans are used for general maintenance, salaries, and overhead, and to boost House Orien’s bottom line.</p><p>While the Couriers Guild is a valuable part of Orien’s business, the Transportation Guild is the house’s financial foundation. Nearly everyone involved with house operations works in the Transportation Guild at some point. Piloting a lightning rail is the most glamorous and prized job in the guild, but beneath every pilot are hundreds of guild operatives whose work keeps the rail running. Orien does not make its employment numbers public, but it is widely surmised that the Transportation Guild is the largest guild in Khorvaire.</p><p>The Transportation Guild’s teleportation services are typically available only at house enclaves. Once the province of nobles and the dragonmarked viceroys, teleportation has taken on a new significance for Orien in the aftermath of the Last War. In the age of exploration, a new class of adventurers and mercenary heroes often has the need (and the coin) to hire those Orien heirs with the greater or Siberys Mark of Passage. In particular, the greater teleport ability of a Siberys heir allows instantaneous travel from mainland Khorvaire to the wilds and riches of Xen’drik. Faced with the prospect of a dangerous, monthlong voyage across the Thunder Sea, many an adventuring party is willing to cobble together the 500 gp required to teleport directly from Sharn to Stormreach.</p><p>As they did all through the Last War, Orien teleporters continue to do a steady trade with the nobility and the dragonmarked houses. The politics of Khorvaire have never been in greater fl ux, and the ability to instantly meet with one’s allies—or just as instantly send spies into the court of one’s foes—is the foundation of the alliances and intrigue that make up the modern age.</p><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1175000,"name":"The Mark of Scribing","type":"text","_id":"aMWAv2haUJYt6VHs","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<img src=\"modules/pf2e-for-eberron/images/MarkOfScribing.png\" class=\" centered\" width=\"131\" height=\"142\" /><blockquote><p>The Mark of Scribing deals with communication—both the written and spoken word.

Language drives the wealth and power of this house, and Sivis has changed the shape of communication in the modern age. It is the arcane mark of a Sivis scribe that proves the worth of a Kundarak letter of credit, and the speaking stones of House Sivis that allow an Aundairian sage to contact his brother in Q’barra. Whether serving as translators, mediators, or conduits for long-distance communication, the heirs of House Sivis build bridges between people, nations, and cultures. House Sivis has long served as a stabilizing force among the dragonmarked houses, and has maintained its reputation for absolute neutrality for nearly three thousand years.</p><h1>The Impartial Voice</h1><p>The society of Zilargo has long revolved around houses: alliances of families wielding great social power. Sivis was an established house even before the Mark of Scribing appeared among its members. Though the mark originally manifested in only a few of the bloodlines within the house, it has since spread to all the Sivis families. The gnomes are a race touched by magic and driven by curiosity, and the bards and sages of Sivis worked quickly to unlock the mark’s full potential. Recognizing the risk of being ostracized for the power they held, the Sivis dragonmarked also sought to make themselves useful to Zil society, even as they distanced themselves from the politics of those they served. In this, they laid the foundation for what would become the standard for the dragonmarked houses: mercantile forces whose neutrality increased their commercial power.</p><p>Within a few centuries, House Sivis spread to other lands, where its heirs’ skills as translators and linguists proved invaluable to the young nations of Khorvaire. Many Sivis gnomes claim that their house was responsible for the refinement and spread of the Common tongue from the Old Common of the earliest Sarlonan migrants.</p><p>As House Sivis spread beyond Zilargo, it made contact with the leaders of the newly created dragonmarked houses, helping to establish the common traditions shared by the houses to this day. As time passed, Sivis would play a critical role in discovering new dragonmarked bloodlines and helping the younger houses establish a foothold in the world. Of all the houses, Sivis has historically had the most interest in the draconic Prophecy and the role of the dragonmarked houses within it. Ever since Alder d’Cannith’s assertion that twelve contemporary dragonmarks would one day be found in Eberron, the sages of Sivis searched for the missing marks.</p><p>Despite its influence, House Sivis has never sought to dominate the houses, instead working to be a friend and ally to all. Of course, the gnomes are a subtle people, and many dragonmarked wonder if the vaunted neutrality of House Sivis is not in fact a mask shrouding a far-reaching hidden agenda.</p><p>Though the sending ability of the Sivis heirs has always been treasured, the house’s greatest turning point was the development of the speaking stone (ECS 263) in 783 YK. Conceived by Tasker Torralyn d’Sivis and developed by the Twelve, the speaking stone allows Sivis heirs who carry the least mark of the house to transmit messages between stones. In 789 YK, the first Sivis message stations appeared in the capital cities of the Five Nations. Since that time, they have multiplied and spread across Khorvaire.</p><p>Today, the house continues as it always has, doing its part to stabilize a world torn apart by war. Though some are quick to write off the importance of a house of scribes, Sivis is an invaluable, integral part of modern civilization.</p><h1>House Sivis in the World</h1><p>House Sivis goes to great lengths to preserve its position as an impartial force in the world. As a result, adventurers are more likely to encounter the house when they need its services, not because they have been caught up in its schemes. At the same time, the gnomes are driven by a thirst for knowledge, a desire for order, and their own maze of internal intrigues—any of which could draw House Sivis into an adventure.</p><p>House Sivis was instrumental in standardizing the system of viceroys, ministers, and seneschals that forms the backbone of dragonmarked hierarchy. Beneath this, the house employs a dizzying array of titles and offices that are largely cosmetic in nature. When two viceroys meet, the Bearer of the Thirteenth Word has a slight social advantage over the Bearer of the Fourteenth Word, but both are still viceroys. Some of these honors can be granted or transferred by a viceroy, some require the intervention of the matriarch, and some are based entirely on social custom. For example, any heir who invents a new idiom is entitled to the honorific “Wordsmith.”</p><p>House Sivis is composed of twelve families, including the Torralyns, Severins, Lyrrimans, Syrralans, Corralyns, and Santors. Political games can be found at all levels of the house, and even a house matriarch can be replaced if a sufficient number of viceroys stand against her. The stability of the house takes precedence over personal ambition, though, and the current matriarch, Doyenne Lysse Lyrriman d’Sivis, has held her post ably for some ninety years. In addition to the Speakers Guild and the Notaries Guild, a number of other important agencies operate within the house. Oversight is the security arm of house Sivis, and defends the house’s reputation for absolute confidentiality and impartiality. Oversight protects Sivis from spies and scrying eyes, but also polices the house membership, swiftly punishing those who threaten the stability of the organization.</p><p>In addition to its own highly skilled operatives, Oversight often works with operatives of Phiarlan and Thuranni, House Kundarak, and the Trust, creating the tightest web of secrecy that gold can buy. As with Zilargo and the Trust, Oversight is allowed a great deal of latitude in its methods: Gnomes who leak house secrets have a tendency to simply disappear.</p><p>The Hidden Word is a division of the Notaries Guild that develops codes and code-breaking techniques, in addition to its work concealing information by magical means. It did a brisk business during the Last War.</p><p>Tasker’s Dream is a think tank. Though Tasker Torralyn d’Sivis worked within the Twelve when he invented the speaking stone, Tasker’s Dream is a private arm of House Sivis dedicated to the development of new forms of magical and linguistic communication. Though House Sivis remains a vital member of the Twelve, its current inhouse projects include dragonshard focus items designed to enhance the sending ability of the greater Mark of Scribing, and exploration of the potential of telepathy.</p><h1>House Sivis's Holdings</h1><p>The oldest Sivis enclave is located in the city of Korranberg in Zilargo, and this remains the heart of the house in the present day. The regional viceroys coordinate efforts from enclaves in the capital cities of every nation of Khorvaire, including Droaam and Darguun. Though Sivis enclaves are designed to facilitate interaction with people of all races, the inner heart of an enclave is constructed for Small humanoids. As such, members of larger races find it difficult to infiltrate a Sivis citadel. Secrecy is of paramount importance to members of the house, and Oversight uses abjuration magic to shield critical areas from prying (or scrying) eyes.</p><h1>Guilds of House Sivis</h1><p>House Sivis controls both the Speakers Guild and the Notaries Guild. The guilds’ bookish reputations (and the insular nature of the house as a whole) means that many of those outside the other dragonmarked houses have little sense of where one begins and the other ends.</p><h2>Notaries Guild</h2><p>The Notaries Guild oversees a vast range of services relating to the written word. In addition to its vital work producing legal documents and authenticating letters of credit, the guild licenses cartographers, bookbinders, and scribes, including those whose specialty is copying magic scrolls. Sivis bookkeepers work with numbers as well as words, and guild appraisers are trained to spot all manner of forgeries. One of the more interesting branches of the guild is the Hidden Word. This arm of the house sells both codes and codebreaking services, along with magical tools such as secret page and illusory script.</p><h2>Speakers Guild</h2><p>Sivis message stations and their speaking stones are the most well-known service of the Speakers Guild, but the guild also oversees a number of professions concerned with the spoken word. The guild licenses barristers, interpreters, mediators, heralds, and similar professions, occasionally overlapping with the spoken arts of House Phiarlan. As a rule, House Sivis handles practical and mundane matters, while artistic endeavors belong to the elves.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1181250,"name":"The Mark of Sentinel","type":"text","_id":"OSOSKmhZw0P8WkWC","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<img src=\"modules/pf2e-for-eberron/images/MarkOfSentinel.png\" class=\" centered\" width=\"131\" height=\"142\" /><blockquote><p>The Mark of Sentinel warns and protects.

I defend the innocent from those who would do them harm. For my siblings, this is a job; for me, it’s a calling.</p><p>—Harric d’Deneith, Sentinel Marshal</p></blockquote><p>Leader: Breven d’Deneith<br />Headquarters: Sentinel Tower (Karrlakton, Karrnath)<br /></p><p>From its beginnings as an order of mercenaries and soldiers to its modern incarnation as the human face of law and battle, House Deneith has maintained its position as the primary force for security and defense in the Five Nations. Though its fortunes rose during the Last War, the services Deneith renders are no less valuable in times of peace. Today, the house is as prosperous as ever, with its position of neutrality firmly established and a host of eager clients ready to use its services. This prosperity tells only half the story, however, and Deneith’s past fortunes might not be enough to guarantee the house’s future.</p><h1>Neutrality and Law</h1><p>Throughout the Last War, Deneith maintained a position of neutrality, serving the whole of Galifar rather than any of its fractured parts. Although this position caused unrest in the house’s home of Karrnath, the Deneith patriarch, Baron Breven d’Deneith, saw the need for a balance of idealism and practicality. Although Deneith’s military forces were nearly the equal of any kingdom, joining with one side (likely Karrnath) would have overwhelmed the house’s resources as it was targeted by the other nations.</p><p>As it happened, its neutral position served Deneith well. At the Treaty of Thronehold, the right of House Deneith to maintain a standing military force was recognized once more. Further, it was agreed to allow members of the house to travel unimpeded by national boundaries for the sake of defending the Five Nations against external threats. Before the war, Deneith bodyguards made up a significant portion of the royal retinues of Galifar, services that remained in demand both during the war and after.</p><p>The central philosophy of House Deneith is built upon fulfilling the letter of the law, with contracts and codes governing every action its members take. The Sentinel Marshals serve an ideal of justice, chasing down criminals no matter where they might hide. For the Defenders and Blademarks Guilds, the law of the land is not half as important as the law of their contract, wherein their services are pledged to a nation or individual under specific circumstances and for a specific length of time. No matter what side of the house one falls on, honor, ethics, and an adherence to oaths sworn form the bulk of a Deneith heir’s reputation. One who keeps his word and fulfills expectations is valued highly, whether his heart tends to good or evil. One who is unreliable or capricious, on the other hand, will find few friends within the house.</p><h1>Dissent Within the Ranks</h1><p>House Deneith’s position of military strength and influence in Khorvaire goes largely unchallenged. Though Deneith is not preeminent among the dragonmarked houses, it has never aspired to be. By maintaining its neutrality and refusing ties to any one nation, Deneith has instead become a force that others must rely on.</p><p>Today, however, this reputation of strength and security means less than at any time in Deneith’s past. In the aftermath of the Last War, the house is quietly buckling under pressure from within and without, and its resources are strained to a degree that few outside the leadership see.</p><h1>Karrnath's Children</h1><p>House Deneith’s headquarters is in Karrlakton, and its roots are set deep in Karrnathi soil. The features and temperament of the Karrns can be found at all levels of House Deneith, from Breven d’Deneith to the mercenary captains of the Blademarks. Deneith is proud of its heritage, but the day of reckoning for that birthright might soon be at hand.</p><p>When the Last War began, House Deneith had a good excuse to claim neutrality. It served Galifar, and would continue to do so even without a crowned king or queen. That neutral stance garnered an amount of respect among the Karrns, who were content that Deneith did not serve their king as long as it served no one else.</p><p>Galifar is little more than a memory now, formally dissolved by the Treaty of Thronehold. The king of Karrnath no longer fights for a place upon the Throne of Galifar, but rather clamors for peace among his brethren. In the eyes of many of his people, Kaius III’s embrace of peace weakens his land.</p><p>This conflict of ideals is causing unrest in Karrnath, and could lead to Kaius’s undoing. At the same time, those Karrns who long for battle against the upstart nations of Khorvaire now wonder how Deneith can refuse to fight for its rightful king, especially when they imagine the glories of a shared Deneith–Karrnath army against the poor remnants of Khorvaire’s other nations. Should Kaius III be deposed and Karrnath led again to war, Deneith’s much-vaunted neutrality might be put to the test—and the sword.</p><h1>Supply and Demand</h1><p>For centuries, House Deneith cornered the market on mercenary forces in Khorvaire. The Blademarks Guild has done business with every major militia and town watch in the Five Nations, as well as provided security forces for other dragonmarked houses, private citizens, and expeditions across Khorvaire and beyond.</p><p>The Last War changed all this, drastically reducing the available pool of experienced soldiers and mercenaries. It was an unpleasant surprise, then, when House Tharashk entered the mercenary market in the dying days of the war. Deneith had never before encountered competition for its services on any meaningful scale, and for another house to engineer such a challenge with the help of the monstrous races of Droaam was a bitter insult.</p><p>House Deneith heirs are human, and humans make up the majority of their forces. Though a smattering of warforged, shifters, and half-elves can be found in Deneith ranks, half-orcs usually prefer to work with House Tharashk, and other races are rare. For Deneith’s work within the Five Nations, human troops were once an advantage, but the outlook in Khorvaire has changed.</p><p>In urban areas such as Sharn, civilized monsters can walk the streets without fear as long as they obey the laws of the realm. House Tharashk helped to pioneer this change, and its actions have placed the house squarely in Deneith’s sights. Deneith is determined to conquer this new mercenary market, either by wresting control from Tharashk or building its own pool of monstrous talent to draw from.</p><p>Neither house admits to any open conflict with the other, but covert clashes occur on a regular basis. If the situation escalates, the rift between the houses might well become irreparable. The dragonmarked houses have traditionally abstained from interfering in intra-house feuds, but no houses have ever before maintained their own standing armies. Open warfare between Deneith and Tharashk is a prospect few among the dragonmarked care to dwell on.</p><h1>Ambition's Thrall</h1><p>Security and ambition are uneasy companions at the best of times. One requires safety, while the other demands risk. Though Deneith’s position in Khorvaire is largely secure, some within the house are convinced that security is simply another word for stagnation. They see the house’s position and wealth as resources to be spent in a larger plan, not treasures to be hoarded. With its martial strength and established presence across Khorvaire, Deneith could be the equal of any of the Five Nations and the master of all the houses. It could be Galifar reborn.</p><p>Those agitating for change within the house believe that the time for a Deneith dynasty is at hand. The house provides security for the crowned heads of the Five Nations and a substantial portion of the nobility, as well as important members of the Twelve and the dragonmarked houses. Deneith forces guard Thronehold, with the house holding the throne in stewardship until a new king or queen is crowned. How better to ensure that happens than to seize the crown for themselves?</p><p>Baron Breven d’Deneith is aware of this movement, but calls it madness. Taking the throne and setting House Deneith to rule Khorvaire would necessitate throwing away everything the house has built and stands for. Such action would pit the house against not just the Five Nations and the other dragonmarked houses, but potentially against the Chamber if the draconic Prophecy were thought to be imperiled. Deneith would be irrevocably ruined—possibly even destroying the Mark of Sentinel as a result.</p><p>Other members of his house do not share Breven’s perspective. In particular, Shirin d’Deneith, a minister within the house, keeps the dark dream of conquest foremost in the thoughts of house members. Though Shirin holds little power from his position alone, he is a charismatic individual. Well spoken and articulate, he has used these gifts to draw like-minded individuals to him. He has also joined the Blood of Vol, using the cult to grant him access to the Order of the Emerald Claw. In doing so, he takes a great risk, since opinion within the house might turn against him if his actions were known. If Shirin has his way, his association with the order will not be discovered until Breven is dead or deposed, and he has seized control of the house.</p><h1>House Deneith in the World</h1><p>House Deneith is a natural presence in almost any campaign. It hires adventurers to protect the nobility and royalty of the Five Nations, to work as mercenaries for private interests, or to track down criminals when the local law lacks the resources (or the inclination) to do so.</p><p>House Deneith was founded centuries ago from a family of warlords in the area that would later become Karrnath. They were the first humans to manifest dragonmarks, and the Mark of Sentinel was only the fourth dragonmark to appear in mainland Khorvaire. The skill of Deneith warlords in battle was already well known, and when the mark appeared in their bloodline, it only added to their fearsome reputation. For over four hundred years, they ruled over the area near modern-day Karrlakton. Then war and a cycle of famine weakened the Deneith leadership and allowed rival factions to challenge it. For nearly two hundred years, war and strife ravaged the land until the rise of its greatest ruler: Karrn the Conqueror.</p><p>Karrn was born and grew to manhood in the lands nominally held by the Deneith warlords. More than one scholar has hypothesized that Karrn might, in fact, have been a member of the Deneith bloodline, though the lack of dragonmarks in his descendants makes that unlikely. Legends tell of how the leaders of House Deneith pledged themselves to Karrn even before he began his quest for power, though their reasons for doing so have been lost to time. Deneith heirs fought at Karrn’s side from the beginning, and this ancient link of service helped shape Deneith into the house it is today.</p><p>From the founding of Karrnath, House Deneith served as both defender of the realm and enforcer of laws. When Galifar grew to adulthood and set out to create his empire, Deneith served him as well. After his kingdom was forged, Galifar I gave House Deneith the duty of defending the entire realm, increasing its jurisdiction fivefold. This new service made considerable use of the Blademarks Guild, for special assignments both in and outside the nation’s borders, and the Defenders Guild, to protect members of the nobility and dignitaries. The Sentinel Marshals were also formed during Galifar’s reign, standing as the king’s right arm against enemies of the realm.</p><p>Promotion within Deneith is based on service to the house, drawing on merit and seniority rather than bloodlines or personal favoritism.</p><h1>Sentinel Marshals</h1><p>The Sentinel Marshals are an elite law enforcement order administered by House Deneith since the rule of Galifar I and upheld as a multi-natioanal force under the Treaty of Thronehold. Only the most trusted heirs of the house are honored with a position in the Sentinel Marshals, either after serving in both the Blademarks and the Defenders Guild, or by special dispensation of the house. The Sentinel Marshals are elite agents authorized to enforce the law across Khorvaire according to the needs of regional authorities, and they have permission to ignore borders in pursuit of fugitives. They are never authorized to break the law, but are held accountable only to the Five Nations as a whole.</p><h1>House Deneith's Holdings</h1><p>Although House Deneith has enclaves across Khorvaire, its seat of power is in Karrlakton, just across the river from the Mournland. Sentinel Tower is Deneith’s ancestral home, named in honor of the mark its members bear.</p><p>Deneith families often send young heirs to be fostered here as children, creating a connection that lasts the rest of their lives. The Tower is the headquarters for all Sentinel Marshals, who return whenever their assignments permit.</p><p>Sentinel Tower is an ancient keep, reputedly older than Karrnath itself. It has undergone extensive expansion over the years, both for defensive purposes and to accommodate growth within the house. Even at its current size, Sentinel Tower cannot contain Deneith’s entire complement of house members and hirelings. As a result, Karrlakton is filled with training areas, barracks, weaponsmiths, armorers, and taverns to serve the needs of the tower.</p><p>In addition to Sentinel Tower, House Deneith holds large enclaves in Sharn and Korth (where the impressive fortress sprawls over an entire hilltop), as well as estates in Flamekeep, Newthrone, Pylas Talaear, Stormreach, Taer Valaestas, Trolanport, and Varna. More outposts can be found in locations throughout Khorvaire, including Rhukaan Draal in Darguun and Graywall in Droaam (where Deneith keeps a low profile in the shadow of the prominent Tharashk enclave). Members of House Deneith are also the protectors of Thronehold, and make up the elite unit of Throne Wardens charged with protecting the Galifaran throne.</p><h1>Guilds of House Deneith</h1><p>House Deneith is more than just the sum of its parts, but how much more is open to interpretation. The house administers two guilds—the Defenders Guild and the Blademarks Guild—as well as the order of the Sentinel Marshals. Active participation in one guild over the course of an individual’s career is mandatory; serving in both is commonplace. Deneith views the guilds as the cornerstone of its mission to protect Khorvaire from its enemies, both within and without. </p><h2>Blademarks Guild</h2><p>The Blademarks Guild is a mercenary branch of House Deneith. It employs mercenaries from across Khorvaire (some associated with House Deneith; some independent contractors), and guarantees both a high level of professionalism and steady work for its hirelings. Deneith’s leadership often arises from within the guild, and the Blademarks are considered the core of the house’s financial success. The cost to hire a Deneith mercenary depends on the experience of the soldier. Hiring fees may be lower in places where there is more competition, such as Sharn.</p><h2>Defenders Guild</h2><p>The Defenders Guild is a mercenary branch of House Deneith. It consists of veterans of the Blademarks Guild, most of whom have at least one year of successful service behind them. The Defenders Guild contains a far greater percentage of dragonmarked heirs than either the Blademarks or the Sentinel Marshals. Its members are well respected within the house, and considered to be a vital part of Deneith’s mission to defend Khorvaire.

We are not simply spies or assassins. We are agents of balance, and through our dance, we shape the future.” —Kaleth Shol d’Phiarlan, ghost of the Serpentine Table</p></blockquote><p>Leader: Elvinor Elorrenthi d’Phiarlan<br />Headquarters: The Demesnes (various)</p><p>The world at large knows the elves of House Phiarlan as entertainers of the highest order. This role is not simply a cover for the secret work of the house, but a tradition that dates back tens of thousands of years. For many members of the house, it is the only trade they follow.</p><p>Though stories abound that attest the elves of Phiarlan are spies and assassins, the people of Khorvaire treat these as children’s tales. Phiarlan’s virtuous performers are known across the continent for their talents—who would believe that they sneak offstage and kill people during intermission? In a world that includes changelings, doppelgangers, and rakshasas, people have enough real spies to worry about.</p><p>In truth, House Phiarlan controls one of the finest intelligence networks in Khorvaire, but these services are available only to guild-masters, nobles, and others the house recognizes as players in the great game of politics and power. How do the twin paths of entertainment and espionage converge? To understand the present, one must look to the past.</p><h2>The Spirit Keepers</h2><p>The roots of House Phiarlan can be traced back to the ancient conflict between the elves and the giants of Xen’drik. The elves of that lost age were not a single, monolithic culture, and in the dying days of the giants, the former slaves among them fought alongside the warriors of a dozen different unconquered elf tribes. A corps of bards and scouts traveled from front to front, carrying news and intelligence that helped coordinate the elves’ attack. These couriers also struggled with the impossible task of maintaining morale and preserving the fragile alliances between the elven tribes. They called themselves Phiarlans, a word meaning “spirit keeper.” As the end drew near, the prophet Aeren called on the Phiarlans to help him gather elves from across the continent, creating the refugee fleet that would ultimately found the nation of Aerenal.</p><h2>Aerenal and the Undying Court</h2><p>Before the rise of the Undying Court, Aerenal was a loose alliance of tribes and city-states. Members of the Phiarlan bloodlines continued to serve as liaisons and troubadours, traveling from court to court bringing songs and news. Phiarlans worked to maintain peace and order through open mediation, but they also began to collect clandestine knowledge on their travels—knowledge that they would anonymously pass to competing tribes and leaders when doing so served the greater good. Gradually, intelligence-gathering became a secret industry for the Phiarlan families, even as their skill with art, song, and dance became a shield against detection.</p><p>With the rise of the undying court, the Phiarlans came into their own as spies, serving the nation of Aerenal as a whole. Their task was a noble one—bringing the light of observation to bear against the shadows of deception so that justice could be served. </p><h2>The Mark of Shadow</h2><p>Some thirty-two hundred years ago, two of the first three dragonmarks appeared among the Aerenal elves. The Mark of Death was limited to the line of Vol, but the Mark of Shadow appeared within a number of elf bloodlines, all tied to the Phiarlans. Though the nature of the marks was a mystery, the elves were quick to recognize their connection to the Prophecy of the dragons—the great wyrms against which Aerenal had intermittently fought for thousands of years. Suspicion was brought to bear against the dragonmarked, and in the end, the very real schemes of the line of Vol were uncovered. The civil war that ensued saw that line and the Mark of Death destroyed, and sent waves of fearful refugees from Aerenal to Khorvaire.</p><p>This exodus included the vast majority of the Phiarlans, fearful that the fury that had destroyed the Mark of Death would be turned against them. A few remained behind and were absorbed into other lines; today, the Mark of Shadow is found among the Aereni from time to time. In Khorvaire, the majority of those elves with the Mark of Shadow set out to create a new life. To mark their departure from Aereni society, they formally joined their lines into a new alliance: House Phiarlan.</p><h2>Phiarlan in Khorvaire</h2><p>The people of Khorvaire had never seen anything to compare to the artistic skills and talents of the exiled elves, and a renaissance in culture quickly spread across the land. Elf entertainers were welcomed in every village and city, allowing Phiarlan’s knowledge and contacts to grow. In time, the leaders of the house parlayed Phiarlan’s reputation into secret contacts with the nobility, and they began to sell the intelligence-gathering skills they had honed over thousands of years while serving as the eyes of the Undying Court.</p><p>Today, House Phiarlan lives in two worlds. Its performers can be found on the greatest stages and in the humblest taverns, and its eyes watch Khorvaire even where no elf is ever seen. Few people realize the true reach of the house, but kings and queens respect its power.</p><p>In 972 YK, House Phiarlan was torn asunder by a conflict that had festered within its ranks for centuries. In the end, the Shadow Schism saw the creation of House Thuranni and the loss of most of House Phiarlan’s holdings in Karrnath and the Lhazaar Principalities. </p><h2>House Phiarlan in the World</h2><p>House Phiarlan uses two symbols: the heraldic mark of the hydra, representing the artistic divisions of the house as well as its resilience, and a stylized silver “mask of shadows.” Some members of the house wear full-sized masks to show their allegiance, while others bear the mask design worked into jewelry or clothing.</p><p>A DM decides which side of House Phiarlan’s mask the players are shown. Most of Eberron sees only the beautiful facade: artists and entertainers, poets and escorts. Only a select few deal with the sixth demesne of House Phiarlan: the spies and assassins of the Serpentine Table. Phiarlan entertainers can be found across Khorvaire, from the grandest gala to the homeliest inn. Phiarlan spies are just as ubiquitous, but rarely seen.</p><p>Taken as a whole, House Phiarlan is a neutral organization. Though its spies frequently engage in illegal activities in the course of their duties, Phiarlan operatives respect the overall structure of society. Like their ancestors, the leaders of the house see themselves as agents of balance, evening the odds between opponents and exposing conflicts that would otherwise fester and grow.</p><p>The elves of House Phiarlan practice hundreds of different styles of song, dance, and other arts, covering both the ancient traditions of Xen’drik and the modern styles of Khorvaire. Long before the house was formed, the early Phiarlans divided the arts into five disciplines, with the greatest masters and teachers of each settling in the five major enclaves of the house, known as demesnes.</p><p>The five disciplines and their demesnes are described below</p><h3>Memory</h3><p>This discipline encompasses the written word, including prose, poetry, and even propaganda. History might be dictated by the victors, but the smartest hire Phiarlan word-weavers to write it down. The Demesne of Memory is located in the city of Fairhaven and run by Viceroy Dulaen Elorrenthi d’Phiarlan, Lord Seneschal of Aundair.</p><h3>Motion</h3><p>These are the arts of the body, including dance, gymnastics, wrestling, contortion, massage, and more. Gifted students of motion are often recruited by the Serpentine Table, their skills adapted to burglary and battle. The Demesne of Motion is located in Wroat, the capital of Breland. It is administered by Viceroy Surael Shol d’Phiarlan, Lord Seneschal of Breland.</p><h3>Music</h3><p>The Demesne of Music teaches the arts of sound, including song and the use of instruments. The demesne is located in the city of Flamekeep, under the leadership of Viceroy Kels Tialaen d’Phiarlan, Lord Seneschal of Thrane.</p><h3>Shape</h3><p>The discipline of shape covers the creation of physical objects. This ranges from purely functional goods (the costumes, props, instruments and the like required by the performers of the house) to the physical arts of sculptors, painters, and potters. The masters of this discipline belonged to the Thuranni lines, and the newborn house claimed the Karrnath enclave that housed the demesne during the Shadow Schism. House Phiarlan has reestablished the Demesne of Shape in the Thrane city of Thaliost, but its operations are overshadowed by those of House Thuranni. Currently the demesne is led by Viceroy Idal Tialaen d’Phiarlan.</p><h3>Shadow</h3><p>In its broadest sense, this is the art of deception. This includes the artistic use of illusions, puppetry, and literal shadow plays, but the Demesne of Shadow also encompasses the verbal arts of deception and coercion, feigning emotion, and playing a role. Actors and orators learn their craft at this demesne, and while a storyteller might create his tales at the Demesne of Memory, he learns to bring those tales fully to life at the Demesne of Shadow.</p><p>The first Demesne of Shadow was located in Metrol, but was relocated to Sharn after the Day of Mourning. The current matriarch of the house, Elvinor Elorrenthi d’Phiarlan, resides at the Demesne of Shadow.</p><p>The Phiarlan hydra has five heads, but a sixth is said to lurk in the shadow of the house crest. The Serpentine Table is the effective sixth demesne of Phiarlan, and the espionage arm of the house. The location of the Serpentine Table is a closely guarded secret, and its placement in the campaign is at the DM’s discretion. It might be in a major city—perhaps even in Sharn, hidden beneath the Demesne of Shadow. It could be concealed within a smaller community, or an entire town that exists only as a front for Phiarlan spies.</p><p>Every Phiarlan enclave has an observer who serves as a liaison with the Table, arranging jobs and ensuring that the local heirs of the house do not interfere with Serpentine operations. Active agents of the group are hidden even from this liaison, often scattered throughout the community and concealed behind layer upon layer of false identity. The true spymaster of a major city weaves her web in the shadows, and no one should ever know her connection to the house.</p><p>Agents of the Serpentine Table hold one of four ranks. The least are known as shadows, and often serve simply as observers. Wraiths coordinate groups of shadows, while specters are elite troubleshooters. Ghosts are the legends of the house. Only a handful of these agents exist, and their identities are carefully guarded. The leader of the  </p><h2>House Phiarlan's Holdings</h2><p>The five artistic demesnes, along with the hidden citadel of the Serpentine Table, are the most important centers of house activity. House Phiarlan has outposts across Breland, Aundair, and Thrane. Where it does not have an enclave, it often maintains a presence at the local Gold Dragon Inn, sharing costs and resources with House Ghallanda. The Serpentine Table also maintains hidden safe houses in cities across Khorvaire.</p><p>Since the Shadow Schism, House Phiarlan has been forced to leave Karrnath and the northeast in the hands of House Thuranni. To make up for this loss of territory, it has been working to explore potential markets in the Eldeen Reaches, Valenar, and Darguun, with somewhat limited success.</p><h2>Guilds of House Phiarlan</h2><p>With hundreds of years to devote to their particular arts, the elf entertainers of Phiarlan are legendary. While the elves are the primary ambassadors of the arts, members of other races can study under Phiarlan as long as they have at least 5 ranks in two or more of a guild’s associated skills, as noted below.</p><h3>Entertainers and Artisans Guild</h3><p>Phiarlan’s Entertainers and Artisans Guild is the foundation on which the house’s reputation is built. Any business associated with the guild (theaters, music halls, circuses, and so on) only employs licensed talent. A character who has at least 8 ranks in an associated skill can earn a place with one of the bound businesses of the house, including the famed Carnival of Shadows: a traveling Phiarlan circus combining illusion, physical arts, and exotic beasts from across Eberron. A character with such credentials can find employment in any major city of Khorvaire.</p><h3>The Serpentine Table</h3><p>The Serpentine Table is the espionage arm of House Phiarlan. It is not a guild in and of itself; few people outside the house even know of its existence, and hardly any of its lower-level operatives realize the full implication of their service. They simply collect and pass along information, never knowing how it is used. Members of the house who wish to operate their own independent intelligence agencies can be licensed by the Serpentine Table, though the house keeps a close watch on such endeavors.</p><p>While it is a simple matter to deal with the Entertainers and Artisans Guild, the Serpentine Table does not advertise its presence. A character seeking to employ the shadowy services of the house can inquire at a main enclave. If the request is worthwhile, it is passed to the Serpentine liaison. When the time is right, an agent will approach the prospective client to discuss the job at hand.</p><hr /><h1>House Thuranni</h1><blockquote><p>“Only from the shadows can one see clearly. Illumination waits for those who dare to step out of the light.” —Taen d’Thuranni, bright phantasm of the Shadow Network</p></blockquote><p>Leader: Elar d’Thuranni<br />Headquarters: Regalport (Lhazaar Principalities)</p><p>Though the Mark of Shadow was the first of the dragonmarks to appear, the elves of Thuranni are the youngest of the dragonmarked houses. Like their cousins in House Phiarlan, the Thuranni lead double lives. Known among the general populace as fi ne artists and courtiers, they are equally well known among the knowledgeable elite as purveyors of secrets and dark deeds. In a short time (especially by elven reckoning), the Thuranni Shadow Network has grown to rival and even eclipse its parent sect, the Serpentine Table of House Phiarlan. In espionage and undercover work, agents of the new house have as good a reputation as their Phiarlan brethren. In assassination, House Thuranni has a distinct and dangerous edge—one that makes many within the dragonmarked houses uneasy.</p><p>The edicts of Korth demand that the dragonmarked houses maintain strict neutrality with regard to the political concerns of the land. However, the work of espionage is, by its nature, inextricably linked with the affairs of nations and their partisan concerns. For that reason above all others, existing conflicts within House Phiarlan grew out of control, ultimately leading to House Thuranni’s break from the rest of the house in 972 YK—an event now known as the Shadow Schism.</p><h2>Eyes of All Nations</h2><p>Before the start of the Last War, House Phiarlan had a comfortable working relationship with the heirs of Galifar who sat on the thrones of the Five Nations. The house helped them to maintain order in the kingdom, uncover treasonous conspiracies, and guard against any threat from outside Khorvaire. Phiarlan assassins removed insurgent leaders and other internal threats. On more than one occasion, House Phiarlan helped to enforce the strange laws of inheritance, such as the ones which prevented the eldest child of Breland’s king from ever succeeding to Breland’s throne.</p><p>There were occasions, even in a unified Galifar, when the rulers of the Five Nations plotted against each other and even against their sovereign, and House Phiarlan was often involved in those schemes. Nascent organizations that would eventually grow into Breland’s King’s Citadel, Aundair’s Royal Eyes, and the like relied heavily on intelligence purchased from House Phiarlan.</p><p>With the death of King Jarot, the best efforts of House Phiarlan were no longer able to ensure a peaceful transfer of power, and Khorvaire was plunged into a century of warfare. Each of the Five Nations built up its own corps of covert agents and set them to work against the spies of enemy nations, while continuing to rely heavily on Phiarlan intelligence.</p><p>A house that was more strongly unified to begin with might have been able to remain united even under such circumstances, but House Phiarlan had always been fractious. The Mark of Shadow appeared not in one family line but in several, and relations among the Phiarlan lines had been strained in the past.</p><p>Five lines - the Tialaen, Shol, Elorrenthi, Thuranni, and Paelion - were the most prominent and influential families in House Phiarlan before the schism. Each line had its particular strengths within the broad fi eld of the house’s activities, and preferred clients among the factions and organizations of the Five Nations. Rivalry among those six lines, not to mention the numerous smaller lines within the house hierarchy, often grew fierce. Ultimately, the strains of the Last War proved to be greater than the ties that bound the Phiarlan families together.</p><h2>The Shadow Schism</h2><p>The final blow came in 972 YK. The Order of the Emerald Claw - at the time, an extension of Karrnath’s government - was a favored client of the Thuranni family, as well as the most important espionage-related organization in Karrnath’s government. Knight Superior Kadrath ir’Vardikk, a high-ranking Emerald Claw officer, came to Lord Elar Thuranni d’Phiarlan with information that pointed to a Brelish plot to assassinate both Karnnath’s regent and its young king. The plot relied heavily on the talents of the Paelion line, the most fearsome assassins in House Phiarlan. Sir Kadrath demanded that the Thuranni line eliminate the Paelions before the assassins could carry out their mission.</p><p>At first, Lord Elar was hesitant to strike against his own house. He first tried to verify the information Sir Kadrath had brought him. What the Thuranni agents uncovered, however, was a far greater threat than a simple assassination plot against Karrnath. Lord Tolar Paelion d’Phiarlan, it seemed, had concocted an elaborate scheme to bring the Last War to an end and gather the reins of power in Khorvaire, not in Breland’s hands, but in his own. Part of this plan, Lord Elar learned, involved exterminating the other Phiarlan families as well as the leadership of the other dragonmarked houses.</p><p>Some might have dismissed these plans as megalomaniacal ravings presenting little serious threat. Since they originated in the most fearsome line of assassins in all Khorvaire, however, Lord Elar took them utterly seriously, and he ordered an immediate strike to exterminate the Paelions before Lord Tolar could carry out his plan.</p><p>Lord Elar himself killed Tolar and his immediate family, while the Thuranni agents at his command slaughtered every Paelion within the family holdings in Lhazaar, and every one they could find in Phiarlan holdings across Khorvaire.</p><p>Outraged at this apparent betrayal, Baron Elvinor Ellorenthi d’Phiarlan declared the Thuranni line excoriate. Defiant, Lord Elar refused this punishment, instead declaring the formation of a new dragonmarked house. The clients of the Thuranni family continued doing business with the excoriate house, and Elar - now taking the title of Baron - managed to acquire some clients formerly loyal to the Paelion line.</p><p>To this day, Baron Elar d’Thuranni maintains that he acted out of loyalty to his own house and all the dragonmarked houses, quashing a plot that would have thrown all of Khorvaire into even greater upheaval. There are many sides to the story, however, and - as in all tales of espionage - the truth is hard to discern.</p><p>Some would suggest that the Order of the Emerald Claw actually fabricated evidence against the Paelions, bringing some of it to Lord Elar while planting the rest in the Paelion holdings for Elar’s spies to uncover. Some further suggest a link between the Emerald Claw’s role in the Shadow Schism and Regent Moranna’s decision to outlaw the order just four years later.</p><p>Other theories suggest wilder conspiracies. Some claim that human agents of the draconic Chamber helped to bring the schism about in order to fulfill prophetic claims about thirteen houses or the split of a single house. (Many of these theorists further claim that the same Chamber agents are working to prevent House Cannith from splintering for the same reason.) Others whisper that at least one prisoner in Dreadhold is imprisoned there for his role in fomenting the schism. Still others claim that Lord Elar and Baron Elvinor amicably agreed to a split in the house and used a mutual enemy, the Paelion line, as a scapegoat to cloak their true intentions.</p><p>Whatever the truth, the Shadow Schism was the most important consequence of the Last War as far as the dragonmarked houses are concerned. Just as the empire of Galifar was fractured into smaller nations, so too the Last War left the dragonmarked houses broken, unsure of their role in the new world and their ties to the new political powers of Khorvaire.</p><h2>House Thuranni in the World</h2><p>After the Shadow Schism, House Thuranni adopted the displacer beast as its symbol, invoking that creature’s ability to appear to be in one place while actually in another, a hallmark of Thuranni operatives long before the house’s secession. The Thuranni coat of arms also includes the image of a length of chain attached to a spiked bar. Heirs claim it symbolizes both their power and the chains that once bound them to tradition and to the Phiarlan. Those few who dare to imply that the image’s similarity to a flail - the traditional weapon of the Order of the Emerald Claw - is anything more than coincidence are likely to face mocking derision in public, and in private, much, much worse.</p><p>Where the elves of Phiarlan employ the mask of shadows as a secondary standard, Thuranni has adopted the symbol of a crescent moon, its face wreathed in shadow. Members of the house wear this symbol in the form of a small pendant, often hidden beneath the tunic or shirt.</p><p>Unlike the house from which it split, House Thuranni makes no pretense to neutrality. The house sees its actions as having greater purpose than simply supporting the subtle machinations of lords and kings. This ideological separation combines with the house’s business philosophy to make heirs of Thuranni more ruthless and aggressive than the Phiarlan.</p><p>House Thuranni observes the traditional hierarchy of the dragonmarked, but also maintains divisions based on the roles heirs play within the house. Though House Phiarlan still maintains its own center for the Demesne of Shape in Thaliost, all serious students of architecture, costuming, painting, pottery, and sculpture study at the true heart of the discipline—the House Thuranni enclave in the Karrnathi city of Atur. Thuranni calls its demesne the True Shapers as an unsubtle jibe toward Phiarlan, and students from all races and nations study under its master artists and artisans. The True Shapers is run by Lord Eriz d’Thuranni.</p><p>At the core of House Thuranni, the Dragon’s Path remains dedicated to unraveling the draconic Prophecy as it unfolds on Eberron. Composed primarily of older house members with a strong sense of history and a working knowledge of magic, the Dragon’s Path includes architects, astrologers, historians, and the fi eld agents who do their bidding. The traditions of the Dragon’s Path are unique, and do not overlap with the dragon prophets, the work of the Chamber, or House Sivis’s study of the prophecy. Members of the order believe that the dragons have kept their knowledge of the Prophecy to themselves for far too long, and recall the dragon wars of Aerenal as proof that the great wyrms’ agenda sees the “lesser races” as expendable if need be. The order is administered and convened by Viceroy Ureilya d’Thuranni.</p><p>Where the Serpentine Table is but one aspect of House Phiarlan, its mirror sect among the Thuranni is the true face of the house—and all other sects merely veils of convenience. The talent and vision of Thuranni artists is real, but so too is the dedication with which they pursue other, darker arts.</p><p>Like Phiarlan’s espionage network, the Shadow Network divides its agents into four ranks. Unlike in the Serpentine Table, shadow is the highest rank a member can hope to attain. Those of lowest rank are known as wisps, and they represent a small majority of its membership. Apparitions coordinate groups of wisps, while phantasms are elite operatives and fi eld agents. Each operative is further defined by one of two descriptors. The bright classification signifies an agent who excels at missions of an aggressive nature, including assassination; the pale classification denotes an agent who specializes in deep cover missions of finesse. Though rumors of a fifth rank, an office known as the Master of Shadows, have circulated through Thuranni in recent years, little evidence supports such tales.</p><h2>House Thuranni's Holdings</h2><p>The power of House Thuranni is centered in and around the Lhazaar Principalities. The Shadow Network likes to discourage the idea that its operations are based in any one location, but the powerful families that make up the house claim territories that are more or less their own. The Thuranni family, led by the house patriarch, Elar d’Thuranni, has holdings in the Lhazaar capital of Regalport and in Sharn, and most high-level house business is carried out in these two places. The patriarch has also been developing a massive, heavily fortified family enclave near the northern island of Stonespur for the last two decades.</p><p>The town of Tantamar, on the northern coast of the Lhazaar Principalities, is the center of house activity on the mainland. House Thuranni has additional enclaves in Droaam, Karrnath, and Q’barra, and has established outposts and safe houses across Khorvaire.</p><h2>Guilds of House Thuranni</h2><p>Though the youngest dragonmarked house, Thuranni has House Phiarlan’s centuries of experience to draw on in its business dealings—and its ability to screen its darker business behind artistic endeavors.</p><p>Unlike House Phiarlan, House Thuranni has no interest in opening up to those outside the house. As a result, though it offers artistic training through the True Shapers, such training has no connection to the artistic or espionage activities of the Shadow Network.</p><h3>The Shadow Network</h3><p>Thuranni’s answer to the Entertainers and Artisans Guild is the Shadow Network, a single organization that encompasses both the house’s public and private services. Unlike House Phiarlan, which operates the Serpentine Table as a separate branch of the house, Thuranni’s Shadow Network is an integrated guild. As such, virtually all Thuranni’s artists are involved to some degree in espionage activities, even if only by being aware that their business helps obscure them.</p><p>Agents of the Shadow Network must be loyal to a fault, for they are entrusted with secrets and tasks of critical importance to both the house and its clients. In particular, the Shadow Network accepts assassination work more readily than the Serpentine Table, and this secret is one that network members protect with their lives.

Members of the house see themselves as the heart of the Khoravar (or half-elf) race, divinely chosen to guide their people into the future. The Lyrandar viceroys are proud and ruthless: lords of wind and water, with powers any king would envy. The development of the airship has served to increase Lyrandar’s already considerable power, and the house is poised to become one of the most influential organizations in Khorvaire.</p><h2>Legacy of the Firstborn</h2><p>Though the origins of House Lyrandar remain shrouded in myth, a few solid facts are known. Some twenty-six hundred years ago, a significant number of elves migrated to Khorvaire in the wake of the civil war in Aerenal that destroyed the line of Vol. Where elf and human settlements came into close proximity, intermarriage became common. However, when the earliest generations of half-elves were born, a good number of the elf settlers rejected them, leaving a population of half-caste children spread across human lands. Over the next six hundred years, this population grew.</p><p>According to house doctrine, the founders of Lyrandar were chosen by the gods themselves. The half-elves Lyran and Selavash were the first to manifest the Mark of Storm, both claiming to have received their marks accompanied by visions of the sovereign lords Arawai and Kol Korran. The sovereigns hailed the duo as the true children of Khorvaire. The half-elves were a race made strong through their hybrid blood, and would wield power over both nature and commerce.</p><p>In the decades that followed, Lyran and Selavash traveled across Khorvaire, preaching their vision to others of their kind. Tales of miracles performed by the pair are common, but all that can be said for certain is that both possessed an almost supernatural ability to inspire others of their race. The charismatic duo encouraged half-elves to form their own separate communities and to recognize themselves as a unique race—the Khoravar, or “Children of Khorvaire.” Their followers began to call Selavash and Lyran the Firstborn, naming themselves “children of Lyran,” or Lyrandar.</p><p>As proscribed marriage within the Khoravar community began to make Lyrandar a line of related families, the Mark of Storm spread through those families with great speed. Those blessed by this magic soon became House Lyrandar, operating a small fleet of swift ships and providing fair weather to farmers in need. Long after Selavash and Lyran had passed away, legends of the Firstborn continued to spread. To this day, a good number of Lyrandar believe that the spirits of the founders still guide the house.</p><p>Like many dragonmarked houses, Lyrandar’s fortunes have shifted with the end of the Last War. The Korth Edicts placed limits on the houses owning land and maintaining military forces, but with the collapse of Galifar, Lyrandar has been able to circumvent both restrictions. The house owns a number of stormships, ostensibly to defend its fleets against piracy. The house has also developed extensive holdings in Valenar, and appears to have considerable influence there. </p><h2>House Lyrandar in the World</h2><p>Adventurers who travel by air or by sea do business with House Lyrandar on a regular basis. Yet the kraken lurks beneath even the fairest seas, and it is hard to see how far its tentacles reach. House heirs and half-elf adventurers might find House Lyrandar to be a valuable patron, but those who cross it find that the kraken is a deadly foe.</p><p>House Lyrandar uses the standard hierarchy of the dragonmarked houses. The house leader holds the title of matriarch or patriarch, but is often addressed as “firstborn” by members of the house who believe that Lyran and Selavash speak through her. The current matriarch is Esravash d’Lyrandar, one of the youngest matriarchs in the house’s history.</p><p>In addition to the Raincallers Guild and the Windwrights Guild, House Lyrandar controls a number of smaller agencies and cabals. Sela’s Path is the priesthood of House Lyrandar. The cult reveres Arawai, Kol Korran, Lyran, and Selavash. Its adherents maintain that the souls of the firstborn serve as intermediaries between the Khoravar and the Sovereign Host, just as Tira Miron is said to speak for the Silver Flame.</p><p>Lyran’s Gift is the arcane research arm of the house. The Gift helps Lyrandar spellcasters hone their skills, and it works in concert with House Cannith and the Twelve to develop new forms of magic.</p><p>The Storm Front is rumored to be a cult operating within House Lyrandar whose members believe that the Mark of Storm is not a gift of Arawai and Kol Korran but the mark of the Devourer. Cult members maintain that the greatest members of the house live on as krakens in the deep, and that these immortal elders guide the Storm Front through visions. The Storm Front believes that the power of the Mark of Storm was meant to be used for destruction, and that the Khoravar should seize dominion through force, not wait for their time to come. Darker tales suggest that Esravash is just a figure head or a dupe, and that the Storm Front is the true power guiding House Lyrandar. According to these rumors, the cult maintains hidden enclaves throughout coastal Khorvaire, including Tlalusk Island off the Demon Wastes.</p><h2>House Lyrandar's Holdings</h2><p>The matriarch of House Lyrandar has her seat in Stormhome, an island off the northern coast of Aundair. Lyrandar mages transformed this once-desolate island into a paradise, and it is now home to a number of Ghallanda resorts in addition to the Lyrandar enclave. An Aundairian garrison stationed on Stormhome protects the entrance to Scion’s Sound, but the island is informally considered House Lyrandar’s territory. It has long been a hotbed of intrigue.</p><p>Beyond Stormhome, House Lyrandar has enclaves in most major port cities of Khorvaire, in addition to land in Valenar that it holds in violation of the Korth Edicts. The Valenar elves have little interest in fallen Galifar’s laws, and this suits Lyrandar well.</p><h2>Guilds of House Lyrandar</h2><p>The Windwrights Guild, with its dashing pilots and sleek elemental craft, is the public face of House Lyrandar for most Khorvairians. However, by virtue of its influence on agriculture, the smaller Raincallers Guild arguably has a larger impact on life in Khorvaire.</p><h3>Raincallers Guild</h3><p>A character with the Mark of Storm can summon rain to save farmers from drought or keep a hurricane from devastating a coastal city. The Raincallers Guild has devoted centuries to the development of irrigation systems, dams, canals, levees, and reservoirs to help control the forces of nature. The unmarked members of the guild focus on these services. In addition, Raincallers often serve as traveling emissaries of House Lyrandar, and are trained in the arts of diplomacy. Large cities often have Raincaller outposts, but the guild also maintains a corps of wanderers who travel regular circuits throughout the agricultural regions of the Five Nations.</p><h3>Windwrights Guild</h3><p>The Windwrights Guild dominates the shipping trade. The core fleet of the guild is made up of the elementalbound vessels and airships of House Lyrandar, crewed by heirs of the house and providing speedy transport by water or air. However, the vast majority of the guild is composed of independent captains who need not be heirs of the house, or even half-elves. To earn the flag of the Windwrights Guild, a captain must pass regular inspections and pay house dues. In exchange, the guild connects him with customs and cargo.</p><p>Common belief holds that captains who choose to work outside the guild are likely to suffer “accidents” ranging from deadly weather to sabotage or piracy. Regardless of whether Lyrandar truly engages in such sinister practices, the rumor alone is enough to convince prospective clients to rely on guild shipping, forcing most captains to work within the guild. The sailors of the Lhazaar Principalities are a notable exception to this rule, and there has long been tension between the Windwrights and the eastern sea lords.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1500000,"name":"The Mark of Warding","type":"text","_id":"l6FBHHy8vZak0C2D","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<img src=\"modules/pf2e-for-eberron/images/MarkOfWarding.png\" class=\" centered\" width=\"145\" height=\"147\" /><blockquote><p>The Mark of Warding helps its bearers protect things of value.

They forge the locks that secure royal jewels. And I learned to pick those locks when I was barely out of the crib.</p><p>—Cutter, burglar and Kundarak excoriate</p></blockquote><p>Leader: Morrikan d’Kundarak<br />Headquarters: Korunda Gate (Mror Holds)</p><p>As civilization develops and expands, the need grows for security and standardization in the commerce between peoples. The dwarves of House Kundarak understand this better than anyone else. The power and wealth of this house stem not just from its influence over banking and finance, but from the safeguarding of all valuables. The rich veins of gold, iron, copper, and other minerals found in their hold in the Ironroot Mountains have made the Kundarak dwarves some of the wealthiest individuals on Khorvaire, and the house has spent centuries parlaying that wealth into a financial empire.</p><h2>Wardens of the Gates</h2><p>For as long as anyone can remember, the dwarves of Khorvaire have been a race divided. Long before they came into their own as masters of the Mror Holds, the dwarves of the Ironroot Mountains were locked in bitter infighting. For some seven thousand years, clan fought against clan over disputed territory, mineral rights, and especially honor. Dwarven pride is strong even today, but in an older age of blood and steel, pride was a way of life—and death.</p><p>Though the origins of the dwarf kingdoms of Khorvaire are lost to history, it is known that a unified dwarf nation once spread deep beneath the Ironroot Mountains. Within this kingdom, it came to pass that twelve warriors were exiled for barbarism and unrest, forced to the surface along with their followers by Lord Kordran Mror. The gateways to the kingdom below were closed off by powerful magic, the dwarves told that they would remain in exile until they had found the honor that their barbarism prevented them from attaining. Alongside the exiles, a clan of wardens was sent to the lands above to watch over these gates—a clan by the name of Kundarak. For thousands of years, the exile clans fought among themselves, both for dominance and for the right to return to the kingdom of stone. Even the appearance of the Mark of Warding among the Kundarak clan did nothing to stem the conflict; indeed, it fast became a source of bitterness and distrust among the other clans, who developed no such marks. When Prince Karrn annexed the lands around the mountains for his father King Galifar, the fractious clans were easily subdued.</p><p>As it happened, the dwarves’ subjugation by Galifar was their salvation. Forced to set aside their violent ways, the exiles created a common culture and found the honor they had long sought. In the end, though, this understanding came too late. When the heirs of Kundarak opened the sealed gates, the kingdom of stone was gone, destroyed by the daelkyr while the twelve clans made war on each other. However, with their ancient duty to guard the entrances to the lands below discharged, the Kundarak were free to set their sights on greater tasks.</p><p>With the aid of the gnomes of Zilargo, the Kundarak clan began its transformation into House Kundarak, and it was formally inducted into the dragonmarked houses in 106 YK. By the close of that century, few banking and financial operations on Khorvaire were not under the control or influence of the dwarves of the Mark of Warding. For eight centuries, the once barbaric stonefolk of the mountains worked patiently to establish themselves among the other surface races. When the Last War erupted, the Mror clans declared their independence from Karrnath. Though House Kundarak has never held a seat on the Iron Council, its support was central to the political will that forged the dwarf nation.</p><p>Today, House Kundarak’s affluence and the power of the Mark of Warding cause the house to be held in high esteem. Its clients depend on the house seal that endorses a Kundarak letter of credit as much as they depend on the power of the arcane lock that protects what that credit can buy. Like House Sivis, House Kundarak has a vested interest in remaining (or at least appearing to remain) neutral in its dealings with the other dragonmarked houses, as well as the rulers of the Five Nations. Were this public integrity to be compromised, Khorvaire’s entire financial system would suffer.</p><h2>House Kundarak in the World</h2><p>For millennia, House Kundarak watched its Mror kin claw their way out of barbarism. Today, these proud stonefolk know all too well that when battles must be fought, few respond as brutally and as efficiently as the Mror dwarves. As a result, few houses try harder than Kundarak to avoid conflict, and characters are more likely to encounter House Kundarak by seeking its assistance than running afoul of its plans. In all things, the house sees unity, not conflict, as the means to success.</p><p>The manticore that adorns the Kundarak seal is the symbol of an old legend. In the early days of the dwarves’ exile, the manticores of the Ironroot Mountains were dispassionate observers of the conflict between clans. Then, in early skirmishes between the clans and the Jhorash’tar orcs, the dwarves found themselves steadily pushed back under waves of orc infantry better suited to fighting on the steep mountain slopes. Faced with a real possibility that the clans might not survive a coming midwinter assault, the Kundarak set out to forge an alliance with the manticores. In exchange for magically warding their mountain lairs against the aberrations that hunted there, Kundarak got these creatures to agree to aid the dwarves’ cause.</p><p>When the Jhorash’tar assault came, it was met not only by dwarf axes on the ground but by manticores and their crossbow-wielding riders in the air. The orc threat was turned back, and the relationship between the dwarves and the Ironroot manticores has been strong ever since.</p><p>The Kundarak dwarves hail from an ancient clan structure. As a result, House Kundarak is organized somewhat differently from the system of viceroys, ministers, and seneschals that has become the standard of dragonmarked hierarchy.</p><p>The current head of House Kundarak is Morrikan d’Kundarak, referred to as baron by those outside the house and as lord by those within it. Titles and positions within the house are hereditary, and are always passed down from father to son (or, in rare cases, to nephew) within the Kundarak line. Lord Morrikan is a shrewd and patient patriarch who has ruled his house for over a century. When the Last War broke out, Morrikan’s voice from his observer’s seat at the Iron Council was said to be the first to whisper of independence.</p><p>Below the lord are two additional positions of authority. Chieftain is another hereditary title, borne by the ranking member of a non-Kundarak bloodline within the house. Six house chieftains rule at any given time. Because the bloodlines within the house operate primarily in their own geographic areas across Khorvaire, chieftains end up taking on the standard role of viceroys within House Kundarak. Lord Kundarak is the chieftain for his own bloodline, and thus acts as viceroy for the house in the Mror Holds.</p><p>In ancient times, the hearthwarden was responsible for “keeping the house” of the clan. Today, the title is held by the administrator of a House Kundarak enclave. The majority of hearthwardens are female, and most are spellcasters. Hearthwardens are elected from within the house, but must be approved by the house lord.</p><p>In addition to the Warding Guild’s Iron Gate and Golden Door, the house maintains two lesser-known orders not affiliated with guilds. The Keyguard are often believed to be a subdivision of the Golden Door, and thus controlled by the Warding Guild. The truth is that one can obtain the services of the Keyguard only from the house. The missions of this elite corps of sneaks and security specialists are decided at the upper levels of the house hierarchy.</p><p>The Ghorad’din (“manticore’s tail”) is the secret paramilitary arm of House Kundarak. Outside the house, few have heard of it, and all but a small handful of those are dwarves of other clans. Called into service only rarely, the Ghorad’din is the closest that Kundarak has to a force of house assassins.</p><p>House Kundarak is composed of nine bloodlines, including the Kundarak, the Durbannek, the Ghedin, and the Tuvodni. All nine can trace their lineage back to the first wardens who gained the surface world alongside the exiled clans.</p><h2>House Kundarak's Holdings</h2><p>The first and greatest House Kundarak enclave is the stronghold of Korunda Gate, nestled high in the mountains of Kundarakhold. Nearly twenty thousand dwarves make their homes here, giving the house its own standing army should it ever need one. In the event that Kundarak’s martial and magical prowess proves insufficient (a toe-curling thought), residents of Korunda Gate can flee to the extensive vaults beneath the city, where much of the house’s wealth—and that of select clients—is stored.</p><p>Korunda Gate is large enough to require not just one, but an entire council of hearthwardens. All political, legal, and executive decisions still rest with Lord Kundarak and his family, but the council administers the day-to-day operations of the city as an enclave. The head of this council is given the honorific of matron, a position presently held by Matron Jakela Tuvodni, the stern but much beloved “hearthwarden of hearthwardens.”</p><h2>Guilds of House Kundarak</h2><p>If it’s worth stealing, chances are that one of House Kundarak’s two guilds can help keep it safe. Through its Banking Guild, Kundarak endorses loans (typically at 10% interest per year, plus a collateral requirement of the DM’s choice) and letters of credit, in addition to providing safekeeping for some of Khorvaire’s most valuable treasures. The Warding Guild boasts experts in defenses both magical and mundane.</p><h3>The Banking Guild</h3><p>The Banking Guild oversees all major banking and finance across civilized Khorvaire, particularly in the Five Nations and the Lhazaar Principalities. Professions related to these services are the purview of the guild, which licenses bankers, coinmakers, gemcutters, goldsmiths, jewelers, moneychangers, moneylenders, treasurers, and similar professionals. It also works closely with the other guilds (particularly those of Cannith) to ensure fair standardization and stable pricing on goods and services.</p><h3>The Warding Guild</h3><p>If the Banking Guild is the public face of Kundarak, then the Warding Guild is its quiet twin. The guild provides a wide array of services relating to security and protection, and shoulders the responsibility for licensing locksmiths, security guards, warders, and the like.</p><p>The Golden Door is a division of the Warding Guild that designs and implements security protocols of every kind, from mundane doors and locks to the most complicated magic wards. Among the dragonmarked, House Kundarak is best known for the work of this division.</p><p>The Iron Gate is the sister sect to the Golden Door. When living bodies are necessary for the safeguarding of valuable sites or objects, the soldiers of the Iron Gate are called. The division’s leaders work closely with Deneith’s Defenders Guild, and often send business that way when the job turns more on protection of the living than their material wealth. The soldiers of the Iron Gate are just as capable as Deneith’s, but they try not to step on their human allies’ toes. However, they can and do serve dwarves who prefer the protection of their own kind.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"knTUi1bTspduSmIG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Y7HEiyNZt9aOCVqE"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1670015537826,"modifiedTime":1674935138910,"lastModifiedBy":"knTUi1bTspduSmIG"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"hFmrVY9xPjClRVEV"}
{"name":"8 - The Planes of Eberron","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"Overview","type":"text","_id":"XL0yEEbAdqV89PfE","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>The sky was full of dreams. Countless points of light glittered against the endless darkness. But these were no stars. Some were quite close to Dela, and she could see them more clearly. There was movement within each iridescent sphere, images of people and places from across the world. In one, she could see a child begging on the streets of Sharn. In another, a woman was being crowned, surrounded by cheering people. Dela knew that if she touched one of these spheres, she would enter the dream, experiencing it just as if it was real. If she could find Rusty’s dreams, she could speak to him. Try to save him. But how could she find one dream among the endless multitude?</p><p>It was then that she saw the shadow moving against the darkness. Its body was nearly invisible against the sky, but it was surrounded by a halo of glowing eyes. Gentle had warned Dela about these. Each eye was the essence of a mortal; its dreams had been consumed by the kalaraq and its soul bound to service. And now, it was searching for her.</p></blockquote><p>All mortal are connected on a spiritual level to Eberron’s thirteen planes. This is most obvious with Dal Quor and Dolurrh. When (most) creatures sleep, their spirits are drawn to Dal Quor, where their dreams take shape. When creatures die, their souls are pulled to Dolurrh. These facts are obvious and indisputable. But many people don’t realize that just like their spirits are pulled by Dolurrh and Dal Quor, they’re similarly tied to all of the planes. A storyteller might be inspired by Thelanis without ever knowing it, while an artist’s revelation may come from Xoriat, and a soldier’s courage could flow from Shavarath. The basic energy of life itself flows into the world from Irian, while Mabar consumes both life and hope. These forces are everywhere, as much a part of the soul as gravity is part of the world.</p><h1>Eberron and Its Planes</h1><p>Eberron’s thirteen planes of existence enfold the Material Plane of Eberron itself. Though Eberron is part of a wider multiverse, it’s completely cut off and has its own unique cosmology. Each of these thirteen planes have qualities of both Inner and Outer Sphere Planes as well as a few that have some qualities of the Transitive Planes as defined in the Gamemastery Guide, and affect the Material Plane in subtle and obvious ways. In addition to the constant influence of the planes on each creature, planes can also affect the world more directly, as seen in manifest zones and coterminous periods.</p><h2>About the Planes</h2><p>The most important thing to understand about the planes is that they’re ideas. Each one is a pure, iconic concept. War. Peace. Chaos. Order. They are eternal, and with few exceptions, unchanging. Eberron is the Material Plane, where these concepts come together and interact. It’s a world that feels the passage of time, where life can change and evolve. The planes of Eberron are archetypal ideas. The precise details can change, but there’s always been war in Shavarath, and always will be; that’s what Shavarath is.</p><h2>Planar Effects</h2><p>If adventurers visit one of the planes, they’ll find it has certain unnatural properties that can be felt consistently throughout the entire plane of existence. A plane’s effects can often be felt on Eberron itself; one of the most common effects of manifest zones is to extend one or more of that plane’s properties into the Material Plane, sometimes reliably, other times unpredictably. The article for each plane presents a list of universal effects that affect that entire plane; these generally apply to all creatures within that plane. Time doesn’t pass at the same rate on every plane; it could move faster, slower, or even unpredictably. For spells and similar effects that target oneself or require concentration, the duration is calculated based on the flow of time the caster is currently experiencing. If a spell doesn’t require concentration and is cast on a target other than self (for example, a geas spell), its duration is based on the target’s current plane and time.</p><h2>Planar Denizens</h2><p>Every plane’s inhabitants are unique, but each creature can generally be classified in one of the following categories.</p><p>Manifestations A dragon rains fire down on a platoon of soldiers in Shavarath. Cheering crowds throng the streets of the Amaranthine City of Irian. Dragon, soldiers, crowds—none of these things are truly real. When you dream that you’re taking a test at Arcanix, the sarcastic professor and mocking students aren’t fully sentient spirits; they’re manifestations of Dal Quor, created for that scene, and as soon as you wake, they’ll vanish. These creatures can appear to be sentient, and you might be able to have a conversation with soldiers in Shavarath—but they won’t have anything to say that you couldn’t imagine coming out of the mouth of an extra in a war movie. As a general rule, manifestations can’t leave the layers of the planes that they’re in, and like dreams, they usually don’t persist indefinitely; when their purpose is served, they simply evaporate until they’re needed again. Very rarely, a manifestation might develop a more independent, sentient existence—like the drifters of Dal Quor—though they’re generally still bound to their plane of origin and unable to deviate from their central purpose.</p><p>Manifestations vary by plane; in Dal Quor they’re called figments, while in Shavarath, they’re conscripts. In some planes, the manifestations are formed from the soul-stuff of mortals, while in others they’re entirely imaginary. A plane never runs out of the potential for manifestations, but these creatures typically follow the internal logic of a scene. If you fight a dragon in Shavarath, it feels just like fighting an actual dragon, and when you kill it, it seems dead and you can enjoy your victory. However, if you return a day later, there’s no sign of the corpse, and instead, there’s a new dragon in the sky.</p><p>Some planes don’t have manifestations of creatures, because the ideas they represent don’t need them. Instead, these planes generally rely on native mortals to make up the supporting cast. So while Shavarath needs a constant churn of conscripts in battle, and Dal Quor creates figments to flesh out mortal dreams, other planes—Dolurrh, Fernia, Lamannia, and Syrania—don’t create manifestations. For example, Lamannia needs mortal beasts to tell its story; birth, growth, and even death are part of its concept, and reflecting that requires a mortal population.</p><p>Immortals Immortal beings are an integral part of their native plane, each expressing a particular aspect of its core ideas. For example, in Shavarath, devils embody the concept of war fought in pursuit of tyranny, while angels are living symbols of the endless fight for justice. The name “immortal” doesn’t mean “unkillable”—they can indeed be killed (as discussed in the “Killing Immortals” sidebar). While immortals don’t show the effects of age, some have a limited lifespan and can die a natural death as well. However, their essence is immortal and their numbers remain constant.</p><p>Most immortals don’t care about Eberron. Many consider Eberron to be an unfinished experiment, while their realm is the finished, perfected work of the Progenitors. Others simply believe in their purpose to the exclusion of all other things; to the angel of Shavarath, the eternal battle is the single most important struggle in the multiverse, and leaving their post for even an instant could give the enemy an advantage. So most immortals aren’t concerned with the fates of mortals or their civilizations; of course mortals may die, that’s their most defining feature. An angel has seen many human civilizations rise and fall—what’s one more? While there are a few exceptions—immortals who chose to dwell on Eberron, whether to prey on mortals, observe them, or assist them— immortals are generally bound to their planes, and your problems are not their problems.</p><p>Immortals don’t reproduce as mortal creatures do; if they’re killed, their spiritual essence is instead reabsorbed into the plane and eventually reassembled. For example, in Shavarath, angels and devils are constantly being killed, but they’re just as quickly being reborn to fight again. Immortals are each born as embodiments of specific ideas and don’t choose their path; they’re already mature, possessing their full abilities and knowledge, and imbued with an absolute understanding of their purpose. So while immortals possess great power, they lack the potential of mortals to grow and evolve, and find the idea of questioning their beliefs or straying from their purpose to be inconceivable.</p><p>There are exceptions to all rules, of course. The kalashtar exist because a handful of quori turned against il-Lashtavar. Likewise, radiant idols are angels of Syrania that were corrupted by their time on the Material Plane and desired mortal adoration. But these examples are vanishingly rare. Sometimes it’s because the unusual immortal is born embodying a unique perspective on the usual concept; this is essentially a mutation, as opposed to a choice. In other cases, an outside force might change or corrupt the immortal’s fundamental nature. And rarely, an immortal might have an unusual sense of identity and the ability to choose.</p><p>If an immortal changes in a way that alters its core concept, this is often accompanied by a physical transformation, such as a corrupted angel becoming a radiant idol, thus losing its ability to fly. Immortals may be able to increase their abilities by absorbing other immortals, acquiring artifacts, or through other means unique to their plane. They simply don’t grow or gain experience through time alone; after all, some of them are as old as the universe itself, and in the absence of a dramatic cause, they’re utterly unchanging.</p><p>Mortals Mortal creatures live in the planes, but they’re much like their counterparts in Eberron. They have families and children, and can live quiet lives or be driven by grand ambitions. Unlike manifestations and immortals, mortal creatures can evolve and change their ways, and of course, they can die. In some planes, mortals are either subjugated by immortals or voluntarily serve them; in others, they pursue their own paths. In some cases—such as the merfolk of Lamannia or the eladrin of Thelanis—these creatures are natives of their home plane, were created by it, and have always been a part of it. Others—such as the frost giants of Risia— originally came from the Material Plane and simply carved out a place in their new plane. These non-native mortals may have lived in the planes for many generations, but on a fundamental level, they aren’t truly a part of it</p><p>Planar Variations The same type of creature can appear in different planes—demons can be found in Fernia, Dolurrh, Shavarath, and more. They might use the same statistics, but their appearance and motivations vary dramatically based on their planes, and they have no sense that being “demons” makes them all allies. The balor of Shavarath embodies the savagery of war; its wings are of steel, and blood drips from its notched sword. The balor of Fernia represents the terrifying destructive power of fire; its wings and sword are made of pure flame. With any planar creature—especially immortals—consider the idea it represents and how that can be uniquely embodied.</p><h2>Planar Layers</h2><p>Eberron is the Material Plane, bound by the logical limitations that govern material things. However, its thirteen planes are ideas, and these are potentially limitless. With this in mind, the planes of Eberron are divided into layers—distinct environments or realms that aren’t bound by the laws of physical space nor physically connected. These layers can be tiny, seemingly infinite, or anything in between. A desert may wrap back upon itself, the alleys in a city could twist in impossible ways to always return you to the main square, or you could come to an absolute edge, where everything falls away into an endless void.</p><p>Many scholars—including Dorius Alyre ir’Korran in his celebrated Planar Codex—describe the layers of a plane as a stack; however, the planes of Eberron aren’t physically arranged in a particular order, and there’s no concept of a top or bottom layer. Instead, each layer explores a different facet of the core concept that defines the plane. Lamannia is the Plane of Nature, and each layer showcases a particular environment—there’s an endless ocean, a vast forest, a volcano forever on the edge of erupting. Shavarath is the Plane of War, and each layer contains a different aspect of war—a bitter siege, a bloody melee, a lingering guerilla conflict. Some planes have a core layer that serves as the heart of the plane, such as the Amaranthine Cities of Mabar and Irian. But the layers of Lamannia are all equal in importance.</p><p>While they aren’t stacked, most planes have layers bound by a reliable set of connections. The shape of these connections varies based on the plane. Some are obvious: a massive door sitting in the desert, a pool that reflects a scene from another layer. Others are more subtle; if you come upon an island while sailing on the Endless Ocean of Lamannia and you walk inland, you’ll find that the island is a completely different layer—and when you turn around, the ocean is no longer behind you. A portal doesn’t have to be physical at all; in Thelanis, you can travel to a new layer by acting out the elements of a new story.</p><p>This chapter provides examples of notable layers for each plane, but these are only a sampling. Just as ideas have no limits, there are no limits on the number of layers a plane can contain. In developing or describing a layer to fit your story, keep the core concept of the plane in mind. What differentiates the vast fortress citadel of Irian’s Amaranthine City from a fortress in Shavarath? A fortress in Shavarath is about war; the stones are worn, and there’s a scent of blood and smoke in the air. In Irian, the fortress is a symbol of hope, of an empire on the rise; it’s bright, clean, and may have never seen an actual battle. So while the layers of two planes might initially sound similar, look back to the core concept and consider how that’s reflected in each layer</p><h1>The Material Plane</h1><p>Though travel to the planes is usually quite challenging and dangerous, even adventures on the world of Eberron can be profoundly impacted by the planes that lie beyond. This section discusses some unique aspects of the Material Plane and its place in the wider cosmology of Eberron.</p><h2>Planar Manifestations</h2><p>Even without planar travel, there are many ways the planes can manifest in an adventure. This chapter examines these potential impacts for each plane using three general categories.</p><p>Manifest Zones These are places where the influence of a plane can be directly felt in the Material Plane. Each manifest zone is tied to a particular physical location on the Material Plane; this is true not only for the Eberron side of the zone, but for the region of the other plane it connects to. So if you live near a manifest zone to Thelanis, it always connects to a specific location in that plane; it’s not simply a manifest zone to Thelanis, it’s a manifest zone to a particular region of the Endless Weald (or any other layer of the plane).</p><p>Manifest zones often exhibit one or more of the universal properties of a plane; in a weak manifest zone, their effect might be diminished, and in a strong one, multiple effects might be present. Some manifest zones can serve as direct portals between Eberron and another plane (though travel is blocked to Dal Quor and Xoriat). Most portals only open under certain circumstances—often when the planes are coterminous, when the moon associated with that plane is full, or both. These gateways can allow adventurers to travel to another plane— but can also be the source of unexpected, and sometimes hostile, creatures from other planes.</p><p>Coterminous and Remote The planes of Eberron are often depicted as orbiting the Material Plane, reflecting the fact that they move into and out of alignment with it. When a plane is coterminous, it’s aligned; the plane’s influence grows over the entire world, and it amplifies the effects of existing manifest zones. On the other hand, when a plane is remote, its power fades; since the planes are always influencing the Material in subtle ways, their absence impacts the world as strongly as their presence does. Multiple planes can be coterminous at the same time; these planar conjunctions are often related to the interactions of the moons, and characters proficient in Arcana can usually work out upcoming conjunctions.</p><p>These planar cycles are intended as plot devices, so DMs don’t need to run them on strict calendar cycles. Instead, use them to suit the story. They can add an interesting mechanical twist to an adventure: because Mabar is coterminous, all undead are stronger! They can drive a villain’s plot: Lady Illmarrow must be stopped from activating the device in three days’ time, when both Mabar and Dolurrh are coterminous— a conjunction that won’t happen again for another century!</p><p>It’s ultimately up to the DM to decide when planes are coterminous or remote. If it suits the story for Dolurrh to be remote for the next three days, make it so—just be sure to inform the arcane scholars among the adventurers, who’d likely know such a thing in advance. Other DMs might prefer to have concretely established cycles, which can add their own interesting flavor to an adventure. For example, Mabar is always coterminous on the nights of the new moon closest to the winter solstice, a time known as Long Shadows. On these nights, friends and family gather together and keep lights burning through the night. With this in mind, this chapter does discuss the traditional cycle of each plane, when it’s reliably coterminous or remote—just remember the cycles are there to enhance your story, not limit it!</p><h2>The Skies of Eberron</h2><p>In the myth of the Progenitors, Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber worked together to create the thirteen planes. Following this effort, they rested in the emptiness that lies at the center of the planes—and there, they quarreled. Khyber killed Siberys and tore him apart, then Eberron enfolded Khyber and became a living prison, forming the world itself.</p><p>This could be literal truth. Perhaps the ring in the sky was once the body of a great cosmic wyrm. But even if it’s not literally true, it reflects truths about the world. From the surface, Eberron looks much like Earth; there is soil below your feet and moons and stars above. But the fact is that Eberron is not like Earth, and much of what can be seen isn’t what it appears to be. As far as anyone has determined, Eberron is the sole planet in its Material Plane, and the fulcrum where the thirteen planes come together. Go below the surface of Eberron and you find not a molten core, but the demiplanes of Khyber. So what are the celestial bodies of Eberron?</p><p>The Ring of Siberys This brilliant equatorial band of light dominates the sky. Siberys dragonshards fall from the Ring of Siberys, and its golden color suggests that the entire ring may be comprised of these magical crystals. The Siberyan Theory, as taught at Arcanix and the Arcane Congress, postulates that all arcane magic manipulates energy that radiates from the Ring—and magic itself is the Blood of Siberys.</p><p>The Sun In the Progenitor myth, the three rested in the Material Plane after creating the planes. They created the sun, Arrah, much as mortals might kindle a campfire. This fire remained even after their battle, and continues to provide light, heat, and comfort to the world, functioning much like the sun we’re used to in our own world. In the Sovereign Host, Dol Arrah is the Sovereign of Sun and Sacrifice; her name is, essentially, Warrior Sun.</p><p>The Stars There are stars in the sky of Eberron, but they aren’t the anchors of distant solar systems. There are limits to the Material Plane, and the stars mark those limits; think of them as glittering points in a crystal sphere. The common constellations are figures of ancient dragons—Io, Tiamat, Chronepsis—though most people couldn’t actually say where these names come from. It’s generally assumed that they were handed down by one of the ancient kingdoms of Sarlona, or established by the ancestors of the Aereni—but in fact, the names are from a tradition spread by the sages of Argonnessen.</p><p>The Moons Twelve orbiting moons are visible from Eberron— the former moon, Crya, hasn’t been seen since ancient times, when tales say the empire of the giants destroyed it. Each moon goes through standard lunar phases, but during the month that shares its name, the moon enters an ascendant phase; during this time, the moon is brighter than usual. Each moon is associated with certain personality traits, and it’s believed that people are influenced by the moon that’s ascendant at the time of their birth. But there’s a further complication, because the moons are also tied to the planes, as indicated on the Planar Destinations and Moons table. Each moon enters an additional ascendant phase whenever its associated plane is coterminous, and becomes unusually dim when the plane is remote. So while unusual, it’s possible for there to be two or three ascendant moons at a time if multiple coterminous periods converge.</p><p>The connection between the planes and moons is reinforced by the fact that while on a plane, its associated moon is the only one that can be seen in the sky (though not all planar layers have a visible sky, like the dismal caverns of Dolurrh). While on a moon’s associated plane, the phase of the moon doesn’t necessarily match its current phase on Eberron. It may be fixed in a single phase—such as in Lamannia, where the moon is always full—or its phase might even change from layer to layer. While on a plane, if the moon is visible, it can be identified with a successful Nature check.</p><p>To date, no humanoids have visited one of the moons. Because of this, their true nature remains a mystery. It’s possible that they are orbiting, habitable planetoids, home to exotic creatures and valuable resources. But some sages believe that they aren’t actually physical bodies at all, but rather, planar gateways—if an airship were to somehow fly high enough and attempt to land on a moon, perhaps it would instead pass into the sky of the associated plane. Determining the truth would be an epic adventure!</p><p> </p><table><thead><tr><th>Plane</th><th>Moon</th><th>Traits</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Daanvi</td><td>Nymm, the Crown</td><td>LN, Flowing, Immeasurable</td><td>The Perfect Order</td></tr><tr><td>Dal Quor</td><td>Cyra (believe to be destroyed)</td><td>Subjective Gravity, Flowing, Metamorphic, Immeasurable</td><td>The Region of Dreams</td></tr><tr><td>Dolurrh</td><td>Aryth, the Gateway</td><td>Timeless, Immeasurable</td><td>The Realm of The Dead</td></tr><tr><td>Fernia</td><td>Eyre, the Anvil</td><td>Fire, Immeasurable</td><td>The Sea of Flame</td></tr><tr><td>Irian</td><td>Barrakas, the Lantern</td><td>NG, Positive, Immeasurable</td><td>The Eternal Dawn</td></tr><tr><td>Kythri</td><td>Zarantyr, the Storm</td><td>CN, Erratic, Metamorphic, Immeasurable</td><td>The Churning Chaos</td></tr><tr><td>Lamannia</td><td>Olarune, the Sentinel</td><td>Immeasurable</td><td>The Twilight Forest</td></tr><tr><td>Mabar</td><td>Sypheros, the Shadow</td><td>NE, Negative, Shadow, Immeasurable</td><td>The Endless Night</td></tr><tr><td>Risia</td><td>Dravago, the Herder</td><td>Cold, Timeless, Immeasurable</td><td>The Plain of Ice</td></tr><tr><td>Shavarath</td><td>Vult, the Warder</td><td>Flowing, Immeasurable</td><td>The Battleground</td></tr><tr><td>Syrania</td><td>Therendor, the Healer</td><td>Air, Immeasurable</td><td>The Azure Sky</td></tr><tr><td>Thelanis</td><td>Rhaan, the Book</td><td>Flowing, Immeasurable</td><td>The Faerie Court</td></tr><tr><td>Xoriat</td><td>Lharvion, the Eye</td><td>Erratic, Immeasurable</td><td>The Realm of Madness</td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"The Astral Plane","type":"text","_id":"B5X6pIMSutPgsfK0","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><section class=\"traits\"><p>Subjective Gravity</p><p>Immeasurable</p><p>Timeless</p></section><p><strong>Moon </strong>N/A<br /><strong>Moon and Portal Color</strong> N/A<br /><strong>Native Inhabitants</strong> <span style=\"font-family:var(--journal-serif)\">N/A</span></p><hr /><blockquote><p>While the astral plane is called a “plane,” it has little in common with the thirteen planes of the orrery. It wasn’t created to embody a concept, because it wasn’t created. The Astral Plane is the ultimate foundation of reality, the realm that existed before creation. If you interpret the creation myth literally, the astral plane was the canvas upon which the Progenitors painted existence as we know it. As such, it’s not part of creation; it’s the space that lies between and beyond it. It doesn’t have a purpose; it simply is.</p></blockquote><p>With that said, the fact that the astral plane is the space between spaces gives it value. With a few exceptions - such as the Immeasurable Market of Syrania - the planes of Eberron exist as independent and isolated systems. There’s no direct path from Risia to Fernia, or from Mabar to Lamannia. All of the planes touch the material plane, but manifest zones that serve as gateways aren’t easy to find. Barring manifest gateways, travel between the planes involves passing through the astral plane. Plane shift and gate expedite this process, connecting through the astral in a blink of an eye. Without such magic, travelers must enter and depart the astral plane through the color pools. So why visit the astral plane? The first reason is to go somewhere else; the astral is just the road that will take you there. The second reason is to get away; disconnected as it is from reality and the ravages of time, the astral can serve as the ultimate sanctuary. The third reason is because you need to interact with the travelers or exiles who dwell there - or wish to explore the forgotten debris of previous ages, abandoned and forgotten in the astral plane.</p><h1>Manifest Zones and Coterminous and Remote</h1><p>The astral plane doesn’t produce manifest zones on the material plane, and it never becomes coterminous or remote. It touches all of the planes at various points. These are visible in the astral plane as color pools and allow travelers to exit the astral plane into the connected region. However, these points are generally imperceptible on the other side of the pool. Identifying the astral point and opening the gate requires magical tools that the people of the Five Nations have yet to master. The three civilizations mentioned earlier—Argonnessen, Aerenal, and the Venomous Demesne—have ways to do this. This could involve a specialized ritual, or it could use an astral key that can open color pools from either side—either linked to a particular pool or potentially able to open any pool-point the adventurers can find. Using such methods, a Chamber agent could open an astral gateway to allow adventurers to escape disaster or to quickly pass between distant points in the material plane. Lacking such magic, the only ways to enter the astral plane are to use plane shift, gate, astral projection, or similar spells. With that said, a DM could always decide that there are circumstances under which unwary travelers can fall into the astral plane. Perhaps there’s a graveyard of ships, a point in the Thunder Sea where under the right circumstances, a maelstrom can draw ships entirely out of reality.</p><h1>Planar Effects</h1><p>The astral plane is an endless silvery void. Wisps of silver and gray drift between motes of light—at first glance these seem like stars, but in fact they are the countless pools of color where the other planes bleed into the astral. There is no inherent gravity or orientation; you move by thinking about moving, and if you have no desire to move you will simply be suspended in the void. Some travelers embrace the idea of flying, while others choose to walk across the void even though there’s no ground beneath their feet.</p><h2>Ancient and Enigmatic</h2><p>Divination spells are unreliable in the astral plane. Many of the ruins and relics found in the silver sea are from previous incarnations of Eberron or predate creation itself, and spells of this age can’t unlock their mysteries.</p><h2>Beyond Time and Space</h2><p>Creatures in the astral plane do not age, and are immune to hunger and thirst. Time moves at the same pace within the astral plane as it does on Eberron, but creatures who spend an extensive amount of time in the astral plane often lose the ability to sense the passage of time; a hermit who’s been isolated in the astral plane for thousands of years might believe it’s been a single year.</p><h2>Speed of Thought</h2><p>While in the astral plane, a creature has a flight speed equal to 3 x its Intelligence score. This replaces all other forms of movement the creature possesses, and overrides any spell or effect that grants or increases movement speed.</p><h2>Suspended in the Void</h2><p>Movement in the astral plane only happens by intention, and a creature that isn’t actively moving or being moved will float, suspended in the void. Thrown objects or ranged attacks travel the maximum distance they would travel in the material plane—driven by the intent of the person who launched them—and then come to a stop, floating in the air.</p><h1>Denizens</h1><p>There’s no native life in the astral plane. Those creatures encountered here are either immigrants, travelers passing through, or things that have been created and set here—most by beings or civilizations long forgotten. </p><h2>Travelers</h2><p>While plane shift allows travelers to instantly traverse the astral plane, there are always travelers who make their way across the astral step by step. These include denizens of the outer planes, but not many; the planes are independent systems that are designed to function in isolation. With this in mind, it’s never normal for beings from the planes to be traveling through the astral, and if they are you can be sure there’s a story behind it. Perhaps an efreeti pasha wishes to serve shaved Risian ice at their next gala, and has dispatched a servant to fetch some. Perhaps a condemned archfey is being escorted from Thelanis to the Inescapable Prison of Daanvi, or an angelic Virtue of Knowledge is going to consult the Infinite Archive. Any of these things could happen, but all of them are remarkable events; it’s not like there’s a constant stream of immortals passing through the astral plane.</p><p>Mortal travelers from the material plane are likewise rare, but not unknown. The mages of the Five Nations know of the Astral Plane, but have not yet developed a sustainable form of astral travel. There are currently three civilizations that make use of astral travel.</p><h3>The Dragons of Argonnessen</h3><p>Long ago, a cabal of dragons sought to build within the astral plane; this experiment came to an end with the loss of Sharokarthel (see below). Today Argonnessen sees the astral plane purely as a conduit for travel. Since powerful wyrms will make use of plane shift, most dragons encountered in the astral plane will be in their middle years—accomplished enough to have needs that can only be met in other planes, but not capable of casting plane shift. Loredrakes (dragon scholars) may wish to consult the Infinite Archives of Daanvi or to speak with a particular immortal. Masters of the Hoard (collectors and merchants) may be seeking unique commodities, while Flames of the Forge (artisans and artificers) may be looking for resources that can only be acquired beyond reality.</p><h3>The Elves of Aerenal</h3><p>The Ascendant Councilors of the Undying Court spend a great deal of time in the Astral Plane, working on the grand experiment of Pylas Var-Tolai. Beyond this celestial realm, the Aereni follow in the footsteps of the dragons. The greatest Aereni sages may consult with Virtues in Syrania or browse the Infinite Archive, and Aereni artisans may seek materials that can only be found in the planes. Where dragons found traveling in the astral are usually young, elf travelers are most likely among the most accomplished of their kind still living; astral travel is an established practice, but only the most capable elves will risk its many dangers.</p><h3>The Venomous Demesne</h3><p>Hidden in western Droaam, the Venomous Demesne is less than two thousand years old—a pale shadow in comparison to Argonnessen or Aerenal. But the humans and tieflings of the Demesne are brilliant mages who are pushing the bounds of arcane science. Over the course of the last century they’ve begun to dig deeper into the mysteries of the Astral Plane, both as a corridor through which to reach the planes and as a resource in its own right. Some mages of the Demesne seek to bargain with the Githyanki, while others hope to find forgotten treasures in the ruins of Sharokarthel. So the Demesne doesn’t yet have a large-scale presence in the Astral Plane, but adventurers could encounter Demesne mages either as fellow travelers or as rival explorers competing for plunder and secret knowledge.</p><h2>Immigrants and Exiles</h2><p>There’s no truly native life in the astral plane, but there are creatures—both mortals and immortals—who choose to live within the silver sea. Some have been stranded by mystical accidents. Others are prisoners exiled to the astral plane, cursed so that they cannot leave it; they are trapped in the timeless void, doomed never to return to the world that has forgotten them. There are hermits who have chosen this solitary existence: philosophers who appreciate having an eternity to contemplate the higher mysteries, inventors working on forbidden research, fugitives waiting for their enemies to die of old age. With no need for food or drink, some dwell in complete isolation; explorers could find a Cul’sir giant who has been meditating for the last five thousand years. Other creatures came to the astral plane in groups, and maintain some form of society in the silver sea. The most significant of these are the Githyanki, who escaped the destruction of a previous incarnation of Eberron and now dwell in fortress-ships the size of small towns. However, there are a handful of smaller communities scattered across the infinite void. Some come from lost realities, like the Gith. Others are remnants of fallen civilizations or followers of traditions that have been wiped out on the material plane. Adventurers exploring the deep astral could discover an outpost built by the dwarves of Sol Udar, or a Dhakaani garrison that knows nothing of the chaat’oor. Part of the point of these outposts is to explore the idea of isolation. They don’t need anything from the outside world; they have no need to seek out others and trade with them. Thus they can exist as flies in amber—a Dhakaani force even more isolated than the Kech Dhakaan, goblins who don’t even realize their empire has fallen. Adventurers could find an astral workshop where giants of the Sulat League have been perfecting a doomsday weapon they can use to take vengeance on the dragons, or the labyrinth-tower of an infamous prince of Ohr Kaluun, cast into the astral plane to escape the Sundering.</p><h2>The Githyanki</h2><p>Most of the immigrants and exiles of the astral plane exist in isolation and timeless stagnation, content to be forgotten in the trackless expanse of the void. The Githyanki are the most notable exception to this rule. Tu’narath is a bustling city, fueled by the plunder Githyanki raiders bring in from other planes. The ships themselves are communities, from small vessels that house a dozen raiders to the fortress-ships that hold hundreds. With that said, between dwelling in the astral and pillaging immortal planes, the Githyanki themselves have lost track of time. This has led to a faction in Tu’narath advocating for an invasion of the Material Plane—asserting that a foothold in the material would both allow their population to grow and to give them an anchor in time. The naysayers argue that they don’t belong in the current creation—that they’ve been able to thrive in the astral because it is beyond reality, but that if the Githyanki stake a claim in the material it could trigger unknown metaphysical defenses. </p><p>The Githyanki are warlike and proud. Their ultimate goal is to build their power until they can destroy Xoriat itself, regardless of the consequences this could have to reality. They have a deep competitive streak that could be seen as a need to prove themselves superior to the world that has replaced theirs. Whether merchant or warrior, Githyanki view all interactions through the lens of conflict; every situation has a winner and a loser, and the Githyanki will always be the victors. Note that this doesn’t mean mindless aggression; the Githyanki recognize the need to outwit their enemies, to employ careful strategies and preserve their limited resources. But they are always seeking a path to victory, and they have no compunction about taking anything they desire from the people around them; in the eyes of the Githyanki, only their people are real, and all the trappings of this age are just flawed reflections of their reality. This is one reason the Githyanki raid other planes while leaving the other denizens of the astral plane alone. Even if they are from other realities, the Githyanki recognize the other exiles as kindred in suffering—and beyond that, they prefer not to start battles on their home ground. So the Gith are constantly raiding through the color pools, but they avoid the ruins and outposts of other immigrants in the astral sea. They have limited contact with the Aereni. They feel no love for these creatures of the usurping reality, but see more value in trading with them than in starting a conflict in the void. However, if the Githyanki were to launch an attack against Eberron, it’s likely they would either negotiate a treaty with Aerenal before they begin… or that they would find a way to cripple the Undying Court and launch their conquest with a devastating first strike against the elves.</p><h2>The Forgotten</h2><p>Most of the denizens of the astral plane have a history that can be unraveled and explored. Some come from earlier incarnations, like the Githyanki. Others come from fallen nations—remnants of Xen’drik, Sol Udar, the Empire of Dhakaan. The ruins of Sharokarthel are almost a hundred thousand years old. But there are beings in the astral plane that predate even the age of demons, constructs built and abandoned by civilizations entirely unknown… civilizations that could even predate the Progenitors and the cosmology of Eberron itself. The terrifying Astral Dreadnoughts are one example of these forgotten entities. These gargantuan entities glide through the astral sea, destroying all that they encounter. Some believe that the dreadnoughts were created by the Progenitors to fight any beings that might come from beyond Eberron’s cosmology—that the dreadnoughts exist to fight any would-be gods that might seek a foothold in Eberron. Others believe that the dreadnoughts predate the Progenitors, that they are remnants of a world truly beyond mortal understanding. The dreadnoughts are just one example of those things that may be forgotten in the depths of the astral—powers waiting to be unleashed.</p><h1>Layers</h1><p>The astral plane isn’t divided into layers. It is a singular, seemingly infinite void in which color pools are scattered like stars. Measured using the concepts of the material plane, Tu’narath and Sharokarthel could be tens or even hundreds of thousands of miles apart. This is why it’s possible to find an astral hermitage where a giant philosopher has remained undisturbed for thousands of years… because unless you know what you’re looking for, the astral plane is so vast as to make any particular location a single grain of sand on a vast beach.</p><p>It might seem like this distance would prevent any sort of meaningful travel in the astral plane. If Tu’narath and Sharokarthel are a hundred thousand miles apart, how is an adventurer to move between them? The catch is that movement in the astral plane isn’t measured in miles or even in space; it is purely a concept. The Speed of Thought trait determines a character’s speed in combat, where people must focus on the narrow moment. Outside of combat, movement across the Astral Plane is based on knowing where you wish to go and willing yourself to get there. Travel speed is largely arbitrary. Think of this as searching the skies for a green star and then willing yourself in its direction. Astral color pools are tied to locations within planes; finding a specific pool, or finding a location like Sharokarthel, is a different story. If you have been to the location before, it will usually take around 1d4 x 10 hours to reach it. If you have no intended destination, you can try to navigate based on the constellations formed by the scattered color pools; you’ll eventually find something, whether it’s just a pool or some more interesting outpost or ruin. Someone familiar with astral travel can make an Arcana check to speed travel; this is arbitrary, but a good result can reduce travel time and help the travelers avoid the psychic wind.</p><p>The elves of Aerenal are the most notable astral cartographers in Eberron. The Ascendant Councilors of the Undying Court have spent countless hours exploring the astral sea as thought forms, recording the paths of its constellations and noting interesting ruins and hermitages. If adventurers wish to find adventure in the astral plane, they could just dive into the sea and start swimming… but a torn page from an Aereni atlas could be what they need to get started.</p><h2>Ruins and Hermitages</h2><p>The astral plane may in fact be infinite, and there’s no telling what could be waiting in that void. There’s at least one active city, Tu’narath. But there are many other points of interest scattered in the void. Most of these are ruins. Some are the remnants of actual cities once built in the astral plane, like Sharokarthel. Others are simply pieces of unknown civilizations or lands. These could be from the distant past of this Eberron. They could be remnants of a lost Eberron, such as the Eberron of the Gith. Or they could even be relics of previous creations, realities older than the Progenitors themselves. A few examples…</p><ul><li>A dragon’s skull, ten miles long from snout to horn-tip. The shape doesn’t precisely match any known species of dragon.</li><li>A single tower, seemingly broken off of a larger castle.</li><li>A massive ship, apparently designed for sea travel—a distinctly different design than the Githyanki vessels.</li><li>A mountain peak formed from some sort of smoky crystal.</li><li>A mass of silvery clouds, soft but solid enough to stand on. They drift and shift, but never disperse or drift apart.</li><li>The empty shell of an immense dragon turtle.</li><li>Half of an immense bridge, sheered off sharply in the middle.</li><li>A manor house, preserved with mending magic and tended by unseen servants. It’s impossible to tell how long it’s stood empty.</li><li>A grove of colossal trees, whose roots and branches are intertwined.</li></ul><p>There are many planes in which odd structures can be found. What differentiates the ruins of the Astral Plane from the bizarre landscapes of Xoriat is the fact that ruins generally feel like they had a purpose—they may be encountered out of context, but once the ship was in water and the skull was part of an immense dragon. What makes them unlike the wonders of Thelanis is that while they may have a purpose, the ruins of the astral plane rarely have a story—at least, not one that can be easily discerned. The skull was once part of a dragon, but there are no further clues as to who that dragon was or how it died; if it was once part of a story, that story is long over.</p><p>Ruins are generally abandoned. When immigrants or exiles lay claim to a ruin, it becomes a hermitage. Given that creatures in the astral plane are immune to starvation and thirst, people can live in places that could never support life in the natural world. A massive dragon skull could be inhabited by a clan of winged kobolds, or by a trio of Seekers of the Divinity Within. Again, unlike Xoriat, the denizens of such a realm came from somewhere; if there’s kobolds in the skull, the question is whether they’re from Eberron, a previous reality, or a forgotten creation.</p><h2>Pylas Var-Tolai</h2><p>The Ascendant Councilors of the Undying Court spend a great deal of time in the astral plane—leaving their bodies behind and exploring through astral projection. In part, they are charting the near-infinite expanse; the Aereni have maps of many ruins and hermitages, even though they have left many of the hermits undisturbed. But astral cartography is a side project. Their true interest is something far grander. The astral plane is a place of beginnings. If the myths are true, it is here that the Progenitors laid the cornerstone of creation. The Undying Court seeks to follow in their footsteps—to create a new reality. They are still far from this goal, but using their gestalt power they have managed to create a region within the void—an island they call Pylas Var-Tolai.</p><p>The core of Pylas Var-Tolai is a vast, fortified monastery. This includes a scriptorium where monks draw maps of the astral sea, a vast library holding accounts of all the ruins they have explored, and a vault holding both wonders found in the astral and artifacts deemed too dangerous to be kept in the material plane. There is a council chamber at the center of it where the ascendant councilors commune with one another and exert their power. While the most important inhabitants of Var-Tolai are the astral forms of the ascendant councilors, there is a population of mortal elves—scholars, priests, and soldiers—who are physically present. While Pylas Var-Tolai is primarily a research outpost, it also serves as a waystation for Aereni who have business in the planes; as such it does have a small capacity for guests, and there are usually a handful of travelers along with the permanent staff. Whoever, the monastery is driven by research, not commerce. If adventurers come to the gates of Pylas Var-Tolai, the priests will be more interested in their stories than their gold.</p><p>The most important aspect of Pylas Var-Tolai is the gate at its center. This allows passage to the workshop of the Undying Court… the reality they are creating. This is very much a work in progress, fluid and unsustainable. But they are continuing to work at it. When adventurers visit, the realm on the other side of the gate could be a tiny island or a vast continent. It could be a perfect replica of Aerenal, or it could be a wondrous realm that defies the laws of physics. Visiting adventurers could be asked to explore the nascent realm—to test the creation of the councilors, and identify its flaws.</p><h2>Sharokarthel</h2><p>In the wake of the Age of Demons, the victorious dragons spread across the world. This lead to the first rise of the Daughter of Khyber, which led to a devastating war of dragons that destroyed the nations they’d created and forced them to withdraw later. Ten thousand years later, a loredrake presented a new idea. The Daughter of Khyber drew power when the dragons expanded across Eberron. But the Daughter herself was bound to Khyber. What, then, if the dragons spread not across the material plane, but across the outer planes? This impulse led to the creation of a number of outposts in the astral plane, culminating in the great city of Sharokarthel. This is a city built by dragons, for dragons—a city formed from magic and the immateria, unbound by gravity or weather. The dragons of Sharokarthel built arcane workshops and planar orreries, and amassed hoards drawn from across the planes. But ultimately the theory was proven wrong. The Daughter of Khyber couldn’t touch the dragons in Sharokarthel—but as their glory grew, she could corrupt those dragons still on Eberron, and these corrupted servants could carry the fight to the astral city. This led to the second great collapse. The Daughter was defeated once again, but the dragons were forced to abandon Sharokarthel. They didn’t destroy the glorious city, but they laid powerful wards and curses upon it, ensuring that no casual traveler could claim their abandoned glory.</p><p>There are a number of draconic ruins in the astral plane, but Sharokarthel is the grandest of them all. It surely holds untold wonders and treasures, but it’s protected by powerful curses and traps. Still, there are surely accounts of those defenses somewhere. Perhaps a human sage might stumble upon a book detailing a secret path into Sharokarthel… or perhaps a young dragon might recruit a group of adventurers to accompany them to the abandoned city, hoping to reclaim some treasure of their ancient ancestors.</p><h2>Subspace</h2><p>There are many effects—magnificent mansions, bags of holding, portable holes—that make use of extradimensional spaces. Typically, these are presented as tiny demiplanes, isolated and unconnected; some, such as secret chest, mention the ethereal plane. However, one possibility is that these extradimensional spaces are in fact in the astral plane. A bag of holding can be encountered as a floating force bubble containing objects… while a magnificent mansion is a mansion suspended in the void. If this is the case, someone might be able to find and penetrate those spaces from the outside. Of course, keep in mind that finding a bag of holding in the astral plane would be like finding a bottle dropped into an ocean; the astral plane is potentially infinite. But if a DM follows this route, they could decide that items created with the same technique occupy the same region of the astral plane; that there is a constellation of Cannith bags of holding, a neighborhood of Ghallanda magnificent mansions, or an island formed by the Kundarak Vault network. If this is the case and someone DOES find a way to access any of these things from the outside, it could cause chaos and force the houses to deploy additional security. But it could certainly make for an epic astral heist!</p><h2>Tu'narath</h2><p>In their early days in the astral plane, the Githyanki discovered an immense six-fingered hand floating in the void. This severed hand is charged with arcane power, not unlike Eberron dragonshards. The origins of the hand remain a mystery, but the Githyanki recognized it as a useful resource and a suitable foundation for an anchorage. Most Githyanki prefer to dwell in their ships, but Tu’nararath is the port where the city-ships come together, where the Githyanki unload their planar plunder and tell tales of their glorious battles. And should they plan a conquest, it is here that they will mass their forces.</p><p>The Githyanki have no love of outsiders; if you want a friendly place to conduct commerce, go to the Immeasurable Market of Syrania. However, the Sixth Finger is essentially a foreign quarter where travelers can find shelter and sample some of the wonders the Gith have claimed from across reality. It’s a very rough neighborhood, where you will find exiles, astral prisoners, and worse—but if you’re looking for an astral guide or some exotic planar plunder, you could make a landing at Tu’narath.</p><h1>Astral Stories</h1><p>For most creatures, the astral plane is simply the space that lies between the planes. It’s a path to be traveled, not a destination. But there are many ways that it can drive a story on its own. The adventurers might have to pursue a fugitive who’s slipped through a pool point and into a ruin. They could be tasked to explore a region of the astral sea, to bargain with a Githyanki smuggler, or to help a mad scholar who’s determined to reach Sharokarthel. They could acquire an iron flask holding some unknown spirit from a previous world—what will it take to open it, and would it be better left alone? Here’s a few other ideas.</p><h2>An Ancestor’s Call</h2><p>An Aereni adventurer is ordered to bring their adventuring companions to Shae Mordai, and from their send to Pylas Var-Tolai. An ascendant councilor—one of their distant ancestors—is conducting experiments in creation, and wants their descendant to test the lands beyond the portal. Is this just coincidence, or does the ascendant councilor know something about their descendent as yet undiscovered by the living?</p><h2>Storming the Castle</h2><p>An enemy of the players has built a fortress in the Astral Plane. Using a spell similar to magnificent mansion, they can retreat to their fortress from any location; this allows them to have their evil lair wherever the adventure is taking place. The adventurers could be on a desert island or in a small rustic village, but they’ll still have to pursue the necromancer Demise into her Tower of Death when things go wrong.</p><h2>The Undiscovered Country</h2><p>A Morgrave scholar has discovered three astral keys. One opens a pool-point in Sharn, and they want a group of adventurers to help them explore the other side. The pool-point leads to a Cul’sir outpost in the astral plane. Is it abandoned, or are their ancient giants still lingering in this place? Was it just good fortune that the scholar found the keys, or does someone want the adventurers to stumble into the forgotten outpost?</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"The Ethereal Veil","type":"text","_id":"D5Y8SwzJONyCdc5v","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><section class=\"traits\"><p>N</p><p>Subjective Gravity</p></section><hr /><p><strong>Moon </strong>N/A<br /><strong>Moon and Portal Color</strong> N/A<br /><strong>Native Inhabitants</strong> XXX</p><hr /><blockquote><p>Standing in the Veil, you see a gray shadow of reality. You can see the misty forms of buildings, of trees, of people going about their business… but you cannot be seen or heard, and you cannot affect the adjacent reality. With few exceptions, the Veil is empty. It reflects the adjacent reality, but it holds nothing of its own, and for this reason people rarely stay there for long; there’s no food, no water, and most of the time, no people. The Veil is an extension of whatever plane you’re currently on. Eberron has an Ethereal Veil, but so does Fernia and so does Syrania; the Veil of Fernia is a gray shadow of Fernia, where the fires are cold and you can pass through the obsidian walls..</p></blockquote><p>Two important facts are that while you can see the images of things in the Material plane, you can’t affect them and can move through them. This includes the ground beneath your feet. A creature there can move up and down as easily as walking. This looks like walking, and uses the half your normal movement speed; it’s simply that your feet find purchase wherever you want them to. This also means that you could, for example, just start walking straight down toward the core of the planet. However, you’re walking blind. If you hit a Border or a Haunt, the matter you’re dealing with may suddenly become impermeable, or gravity might reassert itself. And if your magic should fail, you immediately return to the plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take 1d6 damage per 5 feet you were pushed. If you’re deep in solid rock, that could be a very unpleasant return.</p><h1>Breaching The Veil</h1><p>The people of Khorvaire know the Ethereal Veil exists, but there’s limited ways to reach it. The two most common tools are blink (which has a maximum duration of one minute) and etherealness (a high level spell that lasts for up to ten minutes). When you enter the Veil, the magic that keeps you there also affects the objects you bring with you. If you blink across the Veil and drop a Shard of Rak Tulkhesh it will return to the material plane as soon as the spell ends… so it’s not an easy dumping ground for cursed objects, nor is it an easy matter to build things there.</p><p>Here are some more specific ways that you could transit to the Ethereal Veil in Eberron:</p><p>Blink is one of the powers of the Dragonmark of Passage, and House Orien has been exploring the Veil since the mark first manifested. Throughout its history, the house has experimented with ways to increase the duration of ethereal jaunts and to take advantage of their connection to the Veil. The oldest tool in their arsenal is the passage salve, an uncommon form of oil of etherealness that only takes 1 minute to apply; it can be used by any creature, but only an heir with the Mark of Passage can activate its power. The Veil torc allows the Passage-marked wearer to cast etherealness as if it was a 3rd level spell, though the duration is only one hour. The Twelve have been continuing to work on this and may well come up with prototype focus items or eldritch machines that can allow groups of people to linger in the Veil—and naturally, they’ll need bold adventurers to test these new developments!</p><p>The Guild of Endless Doors has always been interested in the Ethereal Veil, and they have been working on their own counterparts to Orien’s focus items. The Guild lacks the resources of the Twelve and anything they produce will be available on a smaller scale, but on the other hand, you won’t need a dragonmark to make use of it. And the Royal Eyes of Aundair could be pushing the Guild to fast-track Ethereal tools that can be used by Aundairian spies!</p><p>Ancient Secrets Humanity may not have mastered the Veil… but the elves of Aerenal are more advanced than the people of the Five Nations, and the dragons of Argonnessen are more powerful still. Sul Khatesh may hold secrets of the Veil that she could share with her Court of Shadows… but at what cost? These paths could provide adventurers—or their enemies—with tools or rituals that support Ethereal exploration.</p><p>Breaking Reality Reality is a toy in the clutches of the daelkyr. A cult of the Dragon Below might tear apart the Veil or even collapse a chunk of reality into it. Consider Stranger Things!</p><h1>The Dangers of the Veil</h1><p>Eberron is a world where the supernatural is part of nature. The Ethereal Veil is part of life, just like air and water—and just like fish adapt to water and birds soar through the air, there are creatures in Eberron who naturally interact with the Ethereal Veil. Phase spiders are a perfect example of this—a predator with a natural ability to cross the Veil at will. </p><p>Night Hags are another possible threat. Along with their nightmares, these fiends have always had free access to the Veil. Every night hag has at least one sanctum hidden in the Ethereal Veil, and most have left other markers and monuments scattered around it. An old iron lantern hidden in the veil might monitor dreams, calling to the hag who forged it when there’s something worthy of attention. A monolith might be a cache where a hag stores the (literal) nightmares she collects—or she might have a stable of equine nightmares hidden in the Veil. Given the vast scope of the Ethereal Veil, adventurers are unlikely to stumble upon hag creations by accident, but night hags can definitely be a source of deadly traps or enigmatic elements waiting to be found across the Veil.</p><p>Another Ethereal-dwelling species are the Ethergaunts. Created by Mordain the Fleshweaver to be his agents in the wider world, but active on the other side of the veil. Imagine a man being questioned about an impossible murder, and when the Medani inquisitve casts see invisibility they are shocked by the hideous creature watching the interrogation from across the Veil. Each ethergaunt has its own task. It’s not another organized enemy; it’s an army of invisible terrors, each pursuing a unique and unpredictable goal as they gather data for their creator. How Mordain created the ethergaunts. Were they made from raw materials? Or did Mordain kidnap Orien heirs—beneath their armor, do ethergaunts have a bizarrely evolved form of the Mark of Passage?</p><p>Beyond this, part of the role of the Veil is to be undiscovered and unknown. It is as vast as the reality itself, and there may be powers within it that humanity has simply never encountered. It’s an alien world waiting to be discover that is all around us, just beyond what our eyes can see.</p><p>All this deals with the broad swath of the Veil, the gray shadow of the reality. But there are places where the Ethereal takes a more concrete form; the two most common of these are Haunts and Borders.</p><h2>Ethereal Haunts</h2><p>Most ghosts in Eberron are souls trapped between Eberron and Dolurrh, driven to complete their unfinished business or held fast by emotions or memories they can’t let go. While they have at least some of their memories from life, most ghosts aren’t fully aware of their condition or the passage of time, and they generally can’t retain new information. These restless spirits are called lingering ghosts.</p><p>When a lingering ghost is bound to a location—typically due to traumatic events that occurred there—it resides in the Ethereal Veil. Most such ghosts aren’t aware of the passage of time. They linger in the ether until something pulls them across the Veil, typically something tied to the anchors keeping them from Dolurrh. Most of the time, a lingering ghost simply drifts through the shadows of the Ethereal Veil, endlessly retracing its steps until something triggers a reaction. However, a lingering ghost driven by exceptionally powerful emotions or memories can reshape the Veil, imposing its own memories upon the the shadows of reality. So it may be that the ir’Halan Manor is a crumbling ruin stripped by looters long ago—but if a warlock blinks into the Veil, they find themselves in a vibrant replica of ir’Halan Manor at its height. There’s a fire in the hearth, music in the air, and guests mingling and murmuring. This is a Haunt—a recreation of the night that Lady ir’Halan was betrayed and murdered. It’s here that her ghost dwells, endlessly recreating that final night. Ethereal travelers can interact with objects and effects that are part of the Haunt; someone who blinks into the memory of ir’Halan Manor will find that they can’t walk through the walls and that normal gravity is in effect, and that they can take a drink from the waiter passing by. However, for the most part the elements of a Haunt are only real within the Veil. A traveler can take a drink from a waiter and they can savor the flavor of it… but when they blink back to reality, the glass fades from their hand and the wine itself fades from their system. In many ways it’s like a powerful illusion; a popular arcane theory asserts that many illusion spells function by shaping the Veil and pulling it into reality. But while you’re in the Veil, a haunt seems real.</p><p>The classic Haunt is tied to a single ghost; if that ghost is destroyed or laid to rest, the Veil will return to its gray shadow of reality. However, a Haunt can also be shaped by a mass surge of emotions or pain so powerful that they leave psychic scars on reality. The site of a massacre, a prisoner of war camp, an orphanage… all of these can leave Haunts on the other side of the Veil. Where the ghost Haunts often perfectly recreate a moment from the past, traumatic Haunts are often more surreal. If you’re in the ruins of a village destroyed by brutal soldiers during the Last War, the Haunt on the other side of the Veil could be haunted by shadowy creatures that blend the traits of Brelish soldier and beast, using the statistics of worgs; the Veil remembers the terror and brutality, not the precise details. As with ghost Haunts, traumatic haunts feel real to people who enter the Veil; travelers can’t move through objects, people can’t walk through the air, and threats can inflict real damage.</p><p>While Haunts are usually tied to locations, a lingering ghost can also be tied to an object… or even to a particular event, such as a song. In such instances the ghost won’t completely transform the Veil, but it will leak elements of its anchoring trauma into the environment.</p><p>See invisibility is a 2nd level spell and allows the caster to peer beyond the Veil. As such, it’s an important tool for mediums and exorcists; as it’s a gift of the Mark of Detection, House Medani inquisitives may be called in to investigate suspected Haunts.</p><p>Beyond ghosts and trauma, there’s another force that can create Haunts within the Veil: the Overlords of the First Age. An unbound overlord can shape reality; a bound overlord might reshape the Veil in its image. The most logical place for this would be around an Overlord’s prison. If you cross the Veil near the prison of the Wild Heart, you might find that the echoes of the woods are not only solid but writhing and aggressive. The Veil in the vicinity of one of Rak Tulkhesh’s prison shards might be stained with blood and the refuse of recent battle… a foreshadowing of Rak Tulkhesh’s desires. Another possibility is that the devotions of a Cult of the Dragon Below could channel the influence of their overlord to shape the Veil in their place of power. Sul Khatesh’s Court of Shadows imagine a magical kingdom that exists beyond the world; it could be that through their devotion, a powerful chapter of the Court could create this shadow-kingdom on the other side of the Veil. If so, the question is whether Sul Khatesh allows her cultists to cross the Veil, or if they simply have the ability to SEE these umbral spires rising behind reality when others cannot. In a twist—in part because otherwise it would be all too easy for House Medani to monitor cults—in my campaign Overlord Haunt effects can’t be seen by see invisibility, though true seeing will reveal their presence; just as rakshasa resist low level spells, the influence of the overlords isn’t so easily revealed.</p><p>Lingering ghosts usually don’t know that they’re ghosts. They linger because they’re trapped in a particular moment or by a powerful anchor, and they interpret all events through that emotional lens. Often when dealing with adventurers, a lingering ghost will fixate on one or more adventurers who bear some similarity to characters from their own personal drama—recognizing the bard as the lover who spurned them, or the rogue as the cousin who ruined them—and completely ignore the other adventurers. They generally can’t be reasoned with and simply won’t hear things that don’t fit their narrative. Persuasion and Intimidation often have little impact on them, because they essentially can’t change their minds… unless the speaker is actually invoking part of the ghost’s story, in which case a check might have some sort of advantage.</p><h1>The Border Ethereal</h1><p>The material plane is influenced by all of the other planes. Where this influence is especially strong, you find manifest zones. Traits of the outer plane bleed into the material, and planar energies may produce unusual flora or fauna. However, often manifest zones aren’t obvious to the naked eye. It’s the influence of Syrania that makes it possible for the towers of Sharn to scrape the sky, but if you never try flying, you might never notice its effects.</p><p>This changes when you cross the Veil. Where another plane touches the material, you’ll find the Border Ethereal—a dramatic blending of the two realms. The Border Ethereal generally reflects the reality of the material plane in its layout and structure; when you blink into the Veil from a tower in Sharn, you’ll still be in a tower with roughly the same shape. But the cliffs over the Dagger are now formed of thick cloudstuff. The towers themselves are formed of crystal and mist. You can see shadow angels circling in the skies, along with whorls of living cloud-stuff.</p><p>Likewise, imagine a Fernian manifest zone in the King’s Forest of Breland. In the material plane, this stretch of jungle is unseasonably warm and prone to flash fires. But when you cross the veil, you find that same forest, except that the trees are always on fire and yet never consumed. Mephits leap from tree to tree, delighting in the flames. While the trees are never consumed, their flames will burn any travelers who touch them, and the stifling heat is deadly to mortals.</p><p>In short, the Border Ethereal takes on some of the elements of the traditional First World (Thelanian Borders) and the Shadow Plane (Borders with Dolurrh or Mabar), while adding a host of other blended realms. However, the stories of the Border Ethereal are smaller in scope and scale than the stories of the planes; you might make a deal with a terrifying hag in a Thelanian Border, but if you want to deal with an archfey or dance in the Palace of the Moon, you need to go to Thelanis itself.</p><p>You can use any of the methods described in Breaching the Veil to reach a Border, but sometimes there are other options unique to the manifest zone. Dance in the ring of mushrooms when Rhaan is full and you might end up on the other side of the Veil. Sacrifice something you love in fire, and your grief might drag you across the Fernian border. These passages shouldn’t be easy—it’s not like the locals should have regular commerce with the Border Ethereal—and most zones don’t have them, but they can provide ways for adventurers to have an adventure across the Veil without having to spend a fortune on oil of etherealness, and a way to have a taste of the planes without entirely leaving home.</p><h2>Denizens of the Border Ethereal</h2><p>One of the major things that distinguishes the Border Ethereal from the planes they’re connected to are the inhabitants. The Border Ethereal resembles a blend of the two planes, and people can see shadows of the inhabitants on both sides of the veil. In the example given above, the angels that can be seen in the skies of the Border Ethereal in Sharn aren’t present in the border; they’re shadowy images of the denizens of Syrania, flying through their own skies. The borders of Shavarath appear war-torn and you may see misty images of conscripts and fiends, but the damage you see in the environment around you wasn’t actually caused by recent action. So for the most part, the Border Ethereal is empty and relatively safe for travelers. However, there are exceptions.</p><h3>Anchors</h3><p>Some Ethereal Borders are home to an anchoring entity, who plays the same basic role as a lingering ghost does with a haunt. This is usually a powerful immortal from the associated plane, but it’s rarely one of the most powerful beings in that plane. A Mabaran Border could be held by a Ultroloth servant of the Empress of Shadows, or a powerful banshee sworn to the Queen of All Tears. A forested Thelanian border might be bound to the tragic story of an exceptional dryad who is a daughter of the Forest Queen, but you won’t find the Forest Queen herself on the Border. A Lamannian Border might be anchored by a massive megafauna beast, while a powerful beholder might watch the world from the Border Ethereal. If it’s possible to pass through a border, the Anchor Lord may control the passage. Anchor lords typically can’t leave their borders, but those with an interest in the material might well recruit mortal agents; this could be an interesting, smaller-scale patron for a warlock, if a campaign is based in a particular region.</p><h3>Denizens</h3><p>Sometimes Borders will have a small population of native creatures from the associated plane. Mabaran Borders are often home to shadows, and sometimes when powerful undead are destroyed in Mabaran zones they linger in the Veil instead of going directly to the Endless Night; a slain vampire might continue to haunt their castle as a wraith in the Border Ethereal. Restless souls can linger on the edge of Dolurrh. A Thelanian Border might have a small population of native sprites… and a Xoriat Border may be home to aberrations. Again, Borders generally aren’t crowded, and the natives will be outnumbered by the misty reflections of the people on the material plane… but some are inhabited.</p><h3>Shades</h3><p>As with Haunts, Borders can manifest illusions relating to their story—creatures that seem so real that they can inflict slight damage, but which have no ongoing existence or logical ecology surrounding them.</p><h3>Travelers</h3><p>Especially in a Border with no Anchor, it’s always possible you’ll encounter other travelers. Set aside Night Hags, Chamber observers, Lords of Dust, or Ethergaunts and you could still find Orien heirs or Royal Eyes of Aundair using the latest tools from the Guild of Endless Doors to spy across the Veil. But in general the Ethereal Veil is a place you pass through—not a place where mortals dwell.</p><h2>Passing Through</h2><p>The Ethereal Veil extends from the plane its attached to, but no farther. There’s no Deep Ethereal, no curtains to other planes; the Astral Plane is the primary corridor for travel. However, the Borders are where planes come together, and it may be possible to move between material and the connected planes in such places. Anchor Lords often have the power to open passages for travelers. Otherwise, passages are often well hidden and may require particular actions to open. There might be a gate of rusted iron in a Shavarath Border that only opens when blood is spilled in anger, or a clearing in Thelanis that provides passage when adventurers tell the story of their destination.</p><h2>The Effects of the Planes</h2><p>Typically the Border Ethereal resembles the overlapping region in the Material Plane—the material foundation—transformed to reflect the influence of the outer plane. The Lamannian Border of a city will be overgrown; the Shavaran Border of a city will be shattered by war. The misty echoes of the creatures of the material plane can be seen moving around, and occasionally echoes of extraplanar beings can be seen as well.</p><p>A crucial feature of the Border Ethereal is that its structures are solid. Explorers can’t walk through the burning trees of a forest in a Fernian Border, or the fortified walls of a Shavaran Border. Gravity is also usually in effect in Borders, so people can’t walk through the air. Here’s a few elements you could find in the Border Ethereal</p><h3>Daanvi</h3><p>Angles feel sharper. People naturally move to an underlying rhythm; the Plane of Truth and No Chance properties are usually in effect. Structures or plants may be formed from metal, perfect and precise. Anything naturally chaotic—the patterns of ivy, clouds—are structured and reliable. Misty images of marching modrons can occasionally be seen.</p><h3>Dal Quor</h3><p>The destruction of Crya severed Dal Quor’s direct connections to the material plane, and just as there are no manifest zones, there’s no Border Ethereal between Dal Quor and Eberron.</p><h3>Dolurrh</h3><p>At a glance, the Border of Dolurrh looks just like the rest of the Ethereal Veil—a grey echo of the material plane, perhaps with a little more mist clinging to the edges. Shades often linger in Dolurrhi borders. Some are husks whose memories have been stripped away, vague grey outlines of people. Others are the spirits of people who have recently died in the area—not so restless as to become lingering ghosts, yet still clinging to the world, unwilling to slip away. Like lingering ghosts, such spirits usually can’t comprehend their situation—but they know they have somewhere to be, something to do. The Dolurrh Border is a dangerous place; the Eternal Entrapment and Inevitable Ennui traits are in effect, and anyone who lingers too long can get trapped forever.</p><h3>Fernia</h3><p>First and foremost, FIRE. Things burn without being consumed. Bodies of water may be replaced by magma or pure fire. Obsidian, brass, and igneous stone are common materials, and the air may be filled with smoke and ash. The Deadly Heat property of Fernia is in effect.</p><h3>Irian</h3><p>The Pure Light property of Irian means that there’s no darkness in an Irian Border. Colors are bright and cheerful. Plants and wildlife appear healthy and vibrant, and things seem fresh and new. Most Irian zones also have the Life Triumphant property; it’s a good place to take shelter when you’re pursued by undead.</p><h3>Kythri</h3><p>A Kythri border has a general resemblance to its material inspiration, but it’s always slowly changing. As one element drifts further away from the aspect of the material that cast it, another will drift back toward it; so again, overall, it resembles the material plane but is constantly shifting. Building materials are constantly in flux; if there’s a row of houses, one might be made from stone and another made from straw; give it an hour and they could both be made from hard candy. The Kythri border has the Constant Change and The Odds Are Odd properties.</p><h3>Lamannia</h3><p>Natural features are exaggerated and weather effects are more dramatic. If the border is in an urbanized area, it will resemble the Titan’s Folly layer of Lamannia: buildings will be overgrown, with roots cracking foundations and nature reclaiming the land. Even if there are no denizens in the Border, shadows of massive beasts can be seen moving through the land. It has the Primordial Matter property of Lamannia.</p><h3>Mabar</h3><p>The Eternal Shadows and Necrotic Power properties of Mabar can be felt in the Border Ethereal, consuming bright light and bolstering undead. The landscape resembles the material foundation, but plants are withered and dying and structures are decrepit and crumbling; it’s a vision of ruin and entropy. Shadows congregate in Mabaran Borders, often following the movements of people in the material world; sometimes their movements can be seen in mortal shadows.</p><h3>Risia</h3><p>Everything is either formed from ice or encrusted with it. Liquids are frozen. Risian Borders have the Lethal Cold and Stagnation effects. There are rarely any creatures in a Risian Border; it is cold and empty.</p><h3>Shavarath</h3><p>Imagine the world at war. The Border resembles its material foundation, but cast through the lens of a bitter, prolonged conflict. Some buildings are ruined, others are fortified. There are craters and smoldering fires. While occasionally there are shades battling or misty visions of fiends and angels, more often than not it feels like an active war zone, as though the enemy could strike at any moment, but no one ever does. This Border has the Bloodletting property of Shavarath.</p><h3>Syrania</h3><p>Syranian Borders take different forms, reflecting the aspects of the plane that manifest in the connected zone. In the Border of Sharn, the Unburdened property is in effect and all creatures can fly; as mentioned earlier, structures are formed of crystal and mist and animate clouds drift around. Another Border might be more grounded, but have the Gentle Thoughts and Universal Understanding properties, allowing all spoken languages to be understood.</p><h3>Thelanis</h3><p>Every Thelanian Border has a story, and builds on the material foundation to sell that story. In one forest, the woods may grow darker and deeper, promising that wolves and far deadlier things lurk just off the path; in another forest, the trees may be full of dancing lights, with misty images of satyrs dancing in the groves. A city may become more beautiful and magical, or it could seem cruel and oppressive if the driving story is one of a bitter tyrant. The story of the Border will be well known to anyone who lives in the region. In the case of the bitter tyrant, the actual rulers may take pains not to resemble the cruel leader of the tale… or it may be that the Border seeps into reality and drives the locals to be cruel. Storybook Logic is in effect, and where there are fey, Words Have Power.</p><h3>Xoriat</h3><p>There is no predicting what a Xoriat border will look like, but it’s always strange and usually disturbing. One Xoriat border may perfectly resemble its material foundation until you realize that all the structures are actually made of flesh and blood; the buildings quiver when you approach, and that low moan isn’t the wind. In another, writhing tentacles stretch up from the earth, burrowing through buildings and grasping any travelers who come to close. Mirrors ripple and reveal unpleasant truths. Colors are disturbing and gravity is unreliable; the Strange Reality property of Xoriat is always in effect.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Khyber: The Worlds Within","type":"text","_id":"N8uzFhRFON5ZGlzc","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><p><strong>Moon </strong>N/A<br /><strong>Moon and Portal Color</strong> N/A<br /><strong>Native Inhabitants</strong> N/A</p><hr /><blockquote><p>Adventurers don’t have to go beyond Eberron to find strange and magical realms. A layer of stone and soil lies beneath the surface of Eberron, and those who delve below may find natural caverns, subterranean ruins of Dhakaani goblinoids, or the realm of the dwarves of Sol Udar. But there’s more to Khyber than rock and mud. The underdark contains countless demiplanes—pockets of space where the rules that govern the Material Plane don’t apply. These are the source of Khyber’s most unnatural aspects, where its fiends are formed and where the daelkyr remain imprisoned in their own layers (similar to the layers of Eberron’s other planes). Demiplanes can be deadly, but they can also provide an unexpected opportunity for exploration and the discovery of wondrous new worlds just below the surface.</p></blockquote><h1>What Are Demiplanes?</h1><p>The demiplanes of Khyber are somewhat like the layers of other planes. Each demiplane has limited space, though it could be as small as a house or as large as a nation. Its borders might be defined by impassible physical barriers or walls of force, or the pocket of space could wrap around—if you walk far enough in one direction, you’ll find you’ve looped back to where you began.</p><p>Reaching a demiplane requires a portal. In some cases, travel also requires rituals or planar conjunctions, and some portals may be impassable, sealed by the ancient wards of dragons or Gatekeeper druids. However, many portals are not only active, but nearly imperceptible; adventurers walking down a tunnel may pass through a portal to the Ironlands without ever knowing it. Portals are static, remaining in one place, and as long as one remains open, adventurers can always retrace their steps to return to it. Demiplanes may have two or more portals, each leading to anywhere on the Material Plane. The realm of Dyrrn the Corruptor has portals beneath the Shadow Marches and the Ironroot Mountains, while both the Kech Shaarat goblinoids of Darguun and the Ghaash’kala orcs of the Demon Wastes make use of portals tied to the Ironlands. As such, demiplanes can allow rapid travel across long distances; adventurers could enter a demiplane below Q’barra, walk what seems like only a mile, then emerge from a tunnel into Breland.</p><p>Demiplanes have much in common with Eberron’s thirteen planes. Natural laws may not apply within, and time, space, or other elements may behave in unnatural ways. A demiplane could have some of the properties of another plane, like the Burning Bright property of Fernia or the Primordial Matter property of Lamannia. But there’s no universal theme that unites all demiplanes; each one is entirely unique. Some sages say that these demiplanes are Khyber’s dreams. Others believe that demiplanes are unfinished ideas—early drafts of reality or seeds that never quite became planes.</p><p>While demiplanes are usually limited in size, there’s no inherent logic to their construction. It’s possible to be a mile below the surface of Eberron when you discover a valley that appears to be open to the sky . . . but it’s not the sky of Eberron! Unlike the planes, the demiplanes of Khyber don’t contain any of Eberron’s celestial objects—there could be moons, rings, even suns in the sky, but they’ll be entirely unfamiliar.</p><p>While there’s no common theme that unites all demiplanes, there are three common categories of demiplane: hearts, prisons, and shadows.</p><h1>Heart Demiplanes</h1><p>The overlords —Rak Tulkhesh, Sul Khatesh, and others—are said to be Khyber’s first children. They were the first fiends to physically manifest, and each overlord brought forth a host of lesser fiends. When a fiend dies, its essence returns to Khyber. Each one is bound to and reincarnated in a particular demiplane within Khyber—the heart of an overlord. This is one reason the overlords can’t be permanently destroyed; each is part of the architecture of Khyber itself, and the overlord’s form that can be encountered in Eberron is simply a projection of its essence. To defeat the overlords, the champions of the Age of Demons used the Silver Flame to bind their immortal essence, preventing them from returning to their heart demiplane to reform. This essentially severed the brain from the heart—but the heart demiplanes still exist. The lesser servants of the overlord—its rakshasa and other fiend minions—return to the heart when they reform, and should an overlord’s bonds be broken, it will recover its full strength in its heart realm.</p><p>Heart demiplanes are relatively small, around the size of a large city. Each reflects the overlord it’s tied to in appearance and properties. Just as the shard-prison of an overlord’s spirit can affect a region, portals to a heart realm often affect the surrounding area; what’s believed to be a manifest zone to Shavarath might instead be a portal to the Bitter Shield. While the overlords aren’t consciously present in their hearts, their essences still permeate them. Heart realms are typically inhabited by a host of lesser fiends bound to that overlord. Many have no desire to return to Eberron until their overlords are free, while others serve in the Lords of Dust, using the heart as a refuge. A few hearts are described below, but there are at least thirty—one for each overlord.</p><h2>The Bitter Shield: Rak Tulkhesh</h2><p>Rak Tulkhesh’s heart is a crimson fortress, with stones soaked in blood and walls studded with rusted iron spikes. Around the tower’s base, rakshasas and other fiends endlessly battle, their pointless struggle reflecting the bloodlust of their master Mordakhesh the Shadowsword often returns to the Bitter Shield between schemes, and is hailed as lord of the fortress. The Bitter Shield has the Unquenchable Fury and Bloodletting properties of Shavarath.</p><h2>The Tower of Shadows: Sul Khatesh</h2><p>The heart of Sul Khatesh is a tower built from black stone traced with silver. It glitters in the light of three unfamiliar crescent moons. Here, it’s always night, and the servants of the Keeper of Secrets sing paeans to the moons as they perform bloody sacrifices and trace eldritch symbols in the soil. The tower holds a library of dark secrets, and beside it, a scriptorium where fiends scribe the books of shadows that may be given to mortal warlocks. Beneath the city of Ashtakala in the Demon Wastes lies a portal to the Tower of Shadows, and the rakshasa Hektula dwells here when she’s not tending to the library of Ashtakala. The Tower of Shadows has the Universal Understanding property of Syrania and the Eternal Shadows property of Mabar</p><h1>Prison Demiplanes</h1><p>When something is described as being “trapped in Khyber,” it usually means it’s trapped in a demiplane somewhere in Khyber. The most infamous prisoners of Khyber are the daelkyr, but there may well be others—either immortal spirits or mortal creatures that were trapped in the demiplane by their enemies.</p><p>Dyrrn the Corruptor dwells in the Palace of Sinew, and Belashyrra in the Citadel of Lidless Eyes (both are described in Eberron: Rising From The Last War). Valaara is bound in the Deepest Hive, described in chapter 8 of this book. It’s said that the daelkyr Orlassk dwells in a fortress carved into a giant gargoyle that roams the tunnels of Khyber; it could be that the gargoyle exists in Orlassk’s prison realm, or perhaps the massive creature contains a portal to its prison.</p><p>When dealing with a prison demiplane, the DM will have to decide the limitations of the portals. In the case of the daelkyr demiplanes, the daelkyr can’t leave them, but other creatures can freely enter or depart. So Dyrrn’s minions can swarm out of the Palace of Sinew, but as long as the Gatekeepers’ seals remain intact, Dyrrn itself cannot leave. The nature of the binding and the power of the daelkyr is such that they have shaped their demiplanes in their image, but lesser creatures could be trapped in more traditional prisons.</p><h1>Shadow Demiplanes</h1><p>Unlike heart and prison demiplanes, shadow demiplanes serve no clear purpose. They aren’t prisons or fortresses of evil, but rather, strange reflections of the world. Much like Xoriat, they often defy natural logic—and this often gives them great value. Beneath the Ironroot Mountains in the Realm Below, the dwarves found a realm where precious stones grow on trees. In the Vale of the Inner Sun, creatures don’t age.</p><p>Many sages call these “shadow demiplanes” because many seem to be shadows of other planes; the Abyssal Forest of Khaar is a reflection of Lamannia, while the Ironlands bears some resemblance to Shavarath. But in fact, demiplanes of Khyber have no ties to the other planes, nor are they touched by the natural influence of Eberron or the celestial light of Siberys. Perhaps the concepts woven into these demiplanes are echoes of Khyber’s dreams or hints of what might have been . . . or perhaps their resemblance is inexplicable coincidence.</p><p>Shadow realms may hold important resources that can be used or harvested—but these regions always have a malevolent aspect. Fiends are common, and even mortal creatures that dwell there are sinister. Remaining in a shadow realm for too long is usually an invitation to corruption. There are countless shadow demiplanes, some small and others vast; those mentioned here are just a few examples.</p><h2>The Abyssal Forest of Khaar</h2><p>At first glance, this seems a primeval forest, but on closer inspection, it’s filled with horrors. The demiplane is tangled in crimson vines filled with blood. It teems with monstrosities, twisted beasts that aren’t as alien as the aberrations of the daelkyr, but just as deadly; even its most charming songbirds are carnivorous and cruel. The forest’s strange vegetation can be used to make potions or deadly poisons, valuable resources— for those willing to brave its horrors. </p><h2>The Ironlands</h2><p>This realm’s entire landscape is formed from metal. Adamantine trees grow razor-sharp leaves, and iron blades of grass cut through soft shoes. This demiplane, which has Shavarath’s Bloodletting property, is home to bands of devils and demons that engage in their own endless wars. These fiends enjoy fighting and oppressing mortals, but fortunately, they can’t leave their realm. The Ghaash’kala orcs of the Demon Wastes raid the Ironlands, pillaging weapons from the warrior fiends. The Kech Shaarat have expanded their deep vault into the Ironlands; over many centuries, these dar have established an alliance with one of the devil clans, allowing them to hold onto this territory. It’s up to the DM to decide on the foundation of this alliance and whether the Shaarat can leverage it in other ways.</p><h2>The Vale of the Inner Sun</h2><p>A widespread cult of the Dragon Below believes that there is a paradise within Khyber, a place free from suffering and death. The Vale of the Inner Sun does exist, and it has the Stillness of Flesh property of Risia and the Light of Life property of Irian. However, there is a price to this immortality; creatures who dwell in the Vale for an extended time become slowly mutated, eventually turning into unique aberrations. The inhabitants of the Vale—some of whom have been there for centuries—have no love of outsiders, and visitors must prove their worth to bathe in the prismatic light of the Inner Sun.</p><h1>House Orien and Demiplanes</h1><p>Demiplanes can serve as wormholes to distant locations— a valuable means of transporting people and goods! Orien has discovered one such passage; its enclaves in the cities of Passage (in Aundair) and Varna (in the Eldeen Reaches) are built above portals that connect to a tiny, safe shadow demiplane. This allows Orien to move between these two cities within minutes. However, the two cities are already close and well connected, so this has remained a secret resource instead of being put to widespread commercial use.</p><p>Recently, however, the war and the Mourning have disrupted many of Orien’s trade routes, and the development of the airship is threatening the house’s dominance of overland travel. Desperate to regain security, Baron Kwanti d’Orien is actively searching for new demiplane channels. He dreams of finding a route providing safe, swift passage across the Mournland, which could become an Orien commercial route or even carry a lightning rail. But Kwanti has no idea just how dangerous demiplanes can be, and in these efforts, he could easily open doors that should’ve been left closed.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Daanvi: The Perfect Order","type":"text","_id":"skcTIDdqCZA8ZLX6","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><section class=\"traits\"><p>LN</p><p>FLOWING</p><p>IMMEASURABLE</p></section><hr /><p><strong>Moon </strong>Nymm, the Crown<br /><strong>Moon and Portal Color</strong> Yellow-Gold<br /><strong>Native Inhabitants</strong> Modrons, Inveitables, Angels, Devils</p><hr /><blockquote><p>There’s a rhythm to Daanvi, a subtle metronome keeping perfect time. If you act without thinking, you unconsciously move to the beat. The streets may be crowded, but everyone walks at the same pace, every foot striking the ground at the same moment. It takes a conscious effort to break this rhythm, change the pattern, stand out from the crowd. Your instincts push you to fall in line, match the pattern, bepart of the great machine.</p></blockquote><p>This is Daanvi, the Perfect Order. It represents the triumph of law over lawlessness, of discipline over chaos. From the perfectly structured insect hives to the inevitable tribunals that judge every mortal action, this is a triumph of order. On the one hand, Daanvi shows how structure and discipline can create enduring systems, and how laws are the backbone of prosperous civilization. On the other hand, it can crush individuality and innovation. It shows that laws can serve justice, but they can also pose an endless series of obstacles, or even be the tools of tyrants. Daanvi encompasses all of these paths. It shows the benefits of law and order—and the risks of taking them too far. </p><h1>Manifest Zones</h1><p>Manifest zones tied to Daanvi - which are relatively uncommon - often share one or more of the plane’s universal properties. Zones with the Plane of Truth property are often used as makeshift courtrooms by local communities, and a number of the largest courthouses in the Five Nations are built in such zones. Intelligence agencies are always searching for zones with the Eyes of the Law property. Other zones simply reflect the unnatural order of the plane—crops innately grow in perfect rows, or residents find they are more naturally inclined to follow orders. Unsubstantiated legends tell of modrons appearing in manifest zones, attempting to “repair” any local buildings and redesigning them to match the architecture of the Perfect Order.</p><h1>Coterminous and Remote</h1><p>Daanvi has coterminous and remote periods, but unlike those of other planes, these have no obvious effects. Some sages believe it may impact the performance of certain rituals or the creation of eldritch machines, and others try to link the rise of major civilizations to coterminous periods, but any supporting examples could be entirely coincidental. Daanvi is noteworthy for its exceptionally long cycle. Traditionally, when Daanvi becomes coterminous, it remains so for an entire century; one hundred years after that, it becomes remote for a century</p><h1>Planar Effects</h1><p>The impulse toward order affects all creatures in Daanvi. It’s impossible to knowingly lie while in Daanvi, and the effects of random chance are reduced. In Daanvi, all things are inherently reliable - remarkable fortune and bad luck are equally rare.</p><h2>Plane of Truth</h2><p>A creature under these effects can't speak any deliberate and intentional lies and takes a –4 status penalty to Deception checks.</p><h2>Impeded Illusion</h2><p>When a creature casts an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is halved.</p><h2>The Eyes of the Law</h2><p>When a creature casts a divination spell, its range is doubled; if that spell has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is also doubled.</p><h2>No Chance</h2><p>The first time in a combat round (always, in exploration mode) that a creature makes an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw (other than a recovery check), treat the roll as a 10. Neither Fortune nor Misfortune traits can be used while under this planar effect.</p><h2>Flowing Time</h2><p>For every 10 minutes that pass in Daanvi, only 1 minute passes in the Material Plane.</p><h1>Denizens</h1><p>All denizens of Daanvi either embody the concept of law and order or exist to be bound by it. Most modrons, angels, and devils perform administrative tasks as they serve as cogs in the grand machinery of their plane. Nearly all of Daanvi’s inhabitants follow an unvarying daily cycle, each denizen limited by its jurisdiction. Some authorities can move freely and enforce laws in multiple layers. But a deva can’t take action in the Iron Ward, even if it feels that an adventurer is suffering injustice, because that ward is under the jurisdiction of the local devils.</p><p>The angels and devils of Daanvi use normal statistics, but their appearance is similar to modrons and inevitables. They might have metallic skin or wings, or even look like living constructs. These immortals are creatures of absolute law and can’t be compelled to break it or act against their nature. Daanvi doesn’t have a significant population of mortals, though there are other immortals in Daanvi beyond those explored by this section, each one representing a facet of the plane; for example, ant-like formians inhabit numerous layers of their own.</p><h2>Modrons and Inevitables</h2><p>Modrons, Daanvi’s most common inhabitants, are embodiments of pure law, with no bias toward justice or oppression. They do their assigned tasks and obey every law; nothing more, nothing less. Monodrones can be found in many layers performing the most basic tasks. More sophisticated modrons perform endless administrative tasks and enforce basic laws.</p><p>Inevitables are powerful constructs dedicated to enforcing the law in all its aspects. Mighty maruts can be assigned to enforce specific contracts; note that these maruts have nothing to do with their counterparts in Dolurrh, just as the devils of Daanvi aren’t related to those in Shavarath. The Justify trait of Daanvian maruts transports victims to the Hall of Justice in Daanvi.</p><p>In addition to the standard modrons and inevitables, all of which are found in Daanvi, there are others that serve specific tasks within the plane. In particular, an entity known as the Kolyarut resides beneath the Hall of Justice, with absolute authority over enforcing the law. The Kolyarut acts through a legion of host bodies, one of which serves on every inevitable tribunal; these beings are also called Kolyarut, though they’re only representatives of the greater force.</p><h2>Angels</h2><p>The angels of Daanvi represent law in the service of justice and the greater good. These immortals enforce the laws, but also do their best to act fairly and to see that justice is done. While angels have duties to attend to and rarely have time to simply chat with random mortals, they’re typically kind and helpful when they do have time. They believe with all their being that law and civilization are the most vital virtues of all, and that the law can’t be set aside for any reason.</p><p>Devas and other angels of similar power are local authorities. They can be found as ministers, magistrates, and sages. A deva may be appointed to serve as a counselor for mortals called before an inevitable tribunal. The devas at the Infinite Archive serve as sages; modrons file and record, but the devas study the data and reflect on it. Meanwhile, powerful planetars serve as high ministers and guardians of important gates and sites.</p><p>Solars dwell in the Panopticon. There are thirteen solars, each assigned to monitor and administer justice within one of Eberron’s planes (though no solar holds dominion over the Material Plane). However, there are a host of restrictions on how and when they may act. Typically, a solar must be invoked by a legitimate authority within the plane in question - so while Hazariel, the Solar of Syrania, is usually called in to cast down radiant idols, Azazar, the Solar of Xoriat, has never yet been called on by that plane. Until called, they watch; while in the Panopticon, solars can observe anything that occurs in the plane of their dominion. Shortly before the shift of the Quor Tarai that produced il-Lashtavar, Tyrala, the Solar of Dal Quor, went to investigate the actions that resulted in Dal Quor being thrown off its planar axis; she hasn’t been seen since.</p><h2>Devils</h2><p>The devils of Daanvi represent law in the service of tyranny and personal gain. In essence, they depict the danger of laws and how order can become an oppressive force. While the angels and devils of Daanvi despise one another, the strict laws determining jurisdiction mean that they rarely come into contact and almost never engage in combat—though it’s common for a devil and an angel to be found in opposite positions arguing a case before an inevitable tribunal in the Hall of Justice.</p><p>Most often, devils are found in layers such as the Iron Ward, where they’re cruel enforcers and tyrants. They can be encountered as guardians and sentinels, though they’re invariably too harsh when it comes to performing their duties. Other devils seek to exploit loopholes and use the law to their advantage, extorting adventurers or otherwise using the law as a weapon. Orthons and erinyes apprehend lawbreakers, while pit fiends serve as executioners in the Hall of Justice.</p><h2>Subjects</h2><p>Every tyrant needs people to oppress, while every utopian society needs people to enjoy its just laws. The countless manifestations of Daanvi, called subjects, serve this purpose. They’re humanoid, but their shape is indistinct. They provide the impression of a person—someone completely normal and unremarkable, often of the same species as the viewer—but no matter how hard anyone tries, it’s impossible to actually focus on them. Conversations with subjects are surface-level at best, with no distinct personality or goals. Subjects pose no threat in combat, and are dispersed if they suffer any damage, only to reform within a few minutes.</p><h1>Layers</h1><p>Daanvi is home to hundreds of layers, and each is a metaphor for a particular aspect of order or civilization. Time is consistent across all layers, though in some, denizens work at all hours, while in others, there are strict regulations about what times certain activities are allowed. Daanvi has its own calendar, but denizens can easily translate it to the standard calendar of Galifar (or any other system) when dealing with visiting mortals.</p><p>Traveling to Daanvi using plane shift or similar abilities takes you to the Prime Gate. The portals between layers are clearly labeled and easily found, with angelic guides happy to provide assistance. Lesser portals are guarded by modrons, while major portals may be maintained by a horned devil or planetar. Travel passes can be obtained at the Prime Gate, though violating local ordinances can result in a revoked travel pass.</p><p>While some rules—such as the system of gateways and travel passes—are universal, every layer has its own distinct laws. Often these are typical - no theft, no assault except in selfdefense. However, layers may have unusual ordinances - no spellcasting illusion magic after noon. The scope of laws, punishment, and enforcement vary considerably based on the oppressiveness of the layer; is it generally just (administered by angels), even-handed (modrons), or oppressive (devils)? In gentler layers, lawbreakers receive an instructive warning from an angel; those in harsher layers aren’t so lucky. In some cases, guardians administer an immediate punishment, as discussed in the “Daanvian Judgment” sidebar. More serious offenders may be taken to the Hall of Justice to face an inevitable tribunal.</p><p>Some of Daanvi’s most noteworthy layers are described below; other layers each express some form of order of civilization, though most are of little interest to adventurers. There are examples of utopian governance, mob justice, and countless other examples of law at work. The Perfect Grange is a vast, precisely maintained farm, displaying the virtues of agricultural discipline. Hive 43 is a formian settlement where immortal ant-like spirits care for their queen; if that doesn’t strike your fancy, maybe one of the other 42 hives will!</p><h2>The Prime Gate</h2><p>Imagine Terminus Station in Sharn, but instead of skycoaches and rail tickets, portals lead to different layers. Hundreds of subjects and modrons mill about, standing in orderly queues as they wait to pass through a portal. By Daanvian law, all travelers must pass through the Prime Gate, where plane shift and astral travel deposit adventurers. If people enter Daanvi through some other means, they’re in violation of the law - never a good idea.</p><p>While the Prime Gate’s bustling appearance suggests Daanvi is as welcoming to travelers as Syrania, most traffic consists of local commuters moving between layers. Extraplanar visitors must acquire travel passes from the Passage Authority; how difficult this is depends on the tone of the Authority when you arrive... and this shifts from day to day. If the Authority is just, the angels keep it moving quickly and smoothly; as long as you truly have a valid reason for your travel, you should be able to pass. If the Authority is even-handed, it’s managed by modrons; it’s possible to get through, but there are immense lines and a lot of redundant paperwork. In addition to having a clearly stated reason for travel, Modrons might only provide access to specific layers, or impose restrictions - “You’ll have to drink that potion now or throw it away.” And if the Authority is oppressive that day, the devils on duty make it a living hell; the question is whether they’re more interested in extortion or tormenting travelers with bureaucratic burdens. Do they want a bribe? Do you need to perform a service for them? This is an archetypal abuse of power; what makes a good story?</p><h2>The Panopticon</h2><p>In the grand tower of the Panopticon, a host of immortals monitor events occurring across Eberron’s planes. Countless modrons observe crystal balls. There are chambers in which angels and devils stand around wide scrying pools, replaying recent events. And in the highest chamber of the Panopticon, twelve solars - with one seat empty - contemplate the events occurring in the planes they are bound to and wait to be summoned by the authorities of those planes.</p><p>The Panopticon is larger than the entire city of Sharn. Different sections are devoted to each of the planes, and some immortals have spent countless years monitoring a particular location or creature. It holds the most powerful and sophisticated scrying network in existence, dwarfing the capabilities of even the dragons of Argonnessen. However, this system is not intended to benefit mortals. Adventurers must have an exceptional reason to secure a travel pass allowing admittance to the Panopticon, and the immortals who work there are not inclined to answer questions.</p><h2>The Hall of Justice</h2><p>The Hall of Justice is an immense complex containing an impossible number of courts and chambers of inquiry. In smaller chambers, immortals debate the actions of the beings observed in the Panopticon. There are angels discussing the Treaty of Thronehold, while inevitables dissect the latest actions in the endless wars of Shavarath. These debates are pro forma; while a judgment is made and recorded in the Infinite Archive, no action is ever taken. The weightier matters are resolved before an inevitable tribunal, led by a Kolyarut, an inevitable representative of the great arbiter of impartial justice whose spirit permeates the hall itself. The tribunal is typically filled out with a planetar and an amnizu, each working to sway the Kolyarut’s deciding vote to their side.</p><p>Adventurers who violate the laws of Daanvi are brought before an immortal tribunal. Usually this is a straightforward matter; the judges question the accused. The accused is granted an Advocate and opposed by a Voice of Justice; typically one of these is an angel, the other a devil. Both of these immortals may conjure images from the lives of the accused, drawing on the records gathered from the Panopticon. Such a case could be resolved quickly, but depending on protocols invoked or evidence sought (“Your honors, I’d like to show you three years of the defendant’s childhood”), a case can take quite a long time. Luckily for the accused, the Flowing Time property of Daanvi ensures that when - or if - they return to the Material Plane, time has passed for their friends and foes much more slowly.</p><p>Once a case is resolved, the inevitable tribunal enacts their judgment; this ruling is final, and can’t be questioned or appealed. </p><h2>The Infinite Archive</h2><p>Dolurrh’s Library merely contains records of every mortal soul that’s passed through it. By contrast, Daanvi’s Infinite Archive contains records on every being that’s ever existed. Here, the data gathered by the Panopticon and the rulings of the Hall of Justice are recorded and efficiently preserved. Records focus on each individual’s deeds, whether they’ve adhered to or violated countless codes of legal and moral standards. Daanvi doesn’t generally do anything with this data; they have no jurisdiction to act on it. So through your life, the immortals of Daanvi have watched and judged your every action. You aren’t rewarded or punished for your deeds, but they know what you’ve done, and it’s forever preserved on your permanent record.</p><p>Mortals must present an excellent reason - or bribe a devil - to get access to the Archive, but it’s not as restricted as the Panopticon. The Infinite Archive lives up to its name, and is unknowably vast. If adventurers have a legitimate inquiry, a deva sage can be quite helpful. Working with modrons is a long and tedious process, while devils make it even more unpleasant.</p><h2>The Iron Ward</h2><p>The Iron Ward, a city of gray stone, embodies the worst aspects of oppressive law. Councilor Alashta, a cruel amnizu, wields absolute power and can’t be questioned or challenged. Most of the subjects of the ward are indentured servants, trapped in inescapable contracts; visitors must be careful not to accept any offers of work in the ward, lest they be similarly trapped. There are regular displays of brutal “justice” in the grand plaza. Imps scurry in the shadows, watching outsiders and carrying news of their actions to the chain devils and erinyes that serve as the brutal police force. While they can’t punish adventurers “unjustly,” they can tempt visitors into misconduct; fiendish merchants and patrons have many appealing offers for adventurers, but almost all would surely lead to breaking a law of the ward, obscure and ridiculous as it may be.</p><p>While the Iron Ward symbolizes the evils of oppressive order, it is driven by order. The police and councilors twist the law and weaponize it, but ultimately even they must obey the laws—the one advantage adventurers have in passing through this place. And while the subjects of the Iron Ward are brutally oppressed, they’re largely symbolic; it’s questionable if the subjects even exist when no one’s around to observe their suffering.</p><h2>The Inescapable Prison</h2><p>Maintained by devils, this oppressive layer is the embodiment of prison - the inevitable consequence of challenging the law. With the full power of Daanvi behind it, the Inescapable Prison makes Dreadhold look like a cell in the local sheriff’s office. It’s designed to hold celestials, elementals, and other beings with vast power; there are convicts here from a half-dozen planes of existence. Mortals can also be imprisoned here; their biological processes are put in suspension, so they don’t need to eat or drink, and they don’t age. It’s rare for mortals to end up here, but there may be a few legendary historical figures, long thought dead, who have instead been held in the Inescapable Prison!</p><h1>Daanvian Stories</h1><p>Daanvi rarely intervenes in daily life, and people don’t often think of it due to its lack of dramatic coterminous and remote cycles. Except for those who live near manifest zones, it doesn’t intrude on people’s lives. The main way Daanvi impacts adventures is if the party needs to get something from the plane itself - they might need knowledge contained in the Infinite Archive, or to know something that can only be seen from the Panopticon. However, they’ll have to have a solid case to get past the Prime Gate . . . or be prepared to bribe a devil.</p><h2>The Wynarn Report</h2><p>After an ambush gone wrong, the adventurers find themselves in possession of a file stolen from the Infinite Archive - an indestructible journal containing deep and dangerous knowledge about someone very important. A king? The patriarch of a dragonmarked house? This could be ruinous if it falls into the wrong hands, and it’s possible that the Archive will send someone - or something - to recover it. Since it can’t be destroyed, what will they do with it?</p><h2>The Trial</h2><p>After an adventuring mishap on another plane -  perhaps in the Immeasurable Market, as Syrania is most likely to invoke Daanvi’s justice - the adventurers are collected by a solar and must account for their actions before an inevitable tribunal.</p><h2>The Convict</h2><p>A longtime ally of the adventurers always wears a mask. During a battle, the mask is knocked aside, revealing a judgment tattoo that signifies LIAR. Is there a reasonable explanation for this?</p><h2>The Contract</h2><p>The adventurers are negotiating a contract they don’t intend to uphold, but the other party has a surprise; using a scroll of planar ally, a Kolyarut inevitable is called to establish an unbreakable contract. Can the adventurers find a way around this? Will they accept the contract’s terms, or face the wrath of the marut and judgment in Daanvi?</p><p> </p><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Dal Quor: The Region of Dreams","type":"text","_id":"BIkEMby8OWLh0LgT","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><section class=\"traits\"><p>Subjective Gravity</p><p>Flowing</p><p>Metamorphic</p><p><span style=\"font-size:11.2px\">Immeasurable</span></p></section><hr /><p><strong>Moon </strong>Crya (believed to be destroyed)<br /><strong>Moon and Portal Color</strong> Not visible in Eberron's ksy: impossibly black, portals are inaccessible<br /><strong>Native Inhabitants</strong> Dreamers, Quori</p><hr /><blockquote><p>Dal Quor is both impossibly distant and remarkably close. Tens of thousands of years ago, the giants of Xen’drik shattered the ties between Dal Quor and the Material Plane. Since then, it’s been permanently remote, and no naturally occurring manifest zone to Dal Quor has been discovered. Not even plane shift or astral travel can allow direct contact with the Region of Dreams. And yet, it’s also the closest of the planes—to visit, just close your eyes. Dreaming is a form of spiritual travel, as your mortal consciousness is drawn to Dal Quor.</p></blockquote><p>Dal Quor is the realm of dreams, a place of imagination where memory and emotion can shape reality. The stories of Thelanis bring people together in a shared tale; by contrast, the dreams of Dal Quor are unique, individual, and fleeting. They’re defined by our experiences and desires, and we rarely remember them when they’re over. Dreams allows us to sift through our subconscious, and they are ours alone - or at least, they should be... if they aren’t manipulated by an outside force. The denizens of Dal Quor reflect the secondary theme of the plane, and - for now, at least - that theme is nightmares. The quori prey on mortal dreams, twisting them to produce the emotions they crave. This doesn’t mean all dreams are nightmares - but when a quori takes an interest in your dream, it’ll usually become one.</p><h1>Manifest Zones</h1><p>The metaphysical damage caused in the conflict between Dal Quor and the giants of Xen’drik broke the ties between Eberron and Dal Quor. There are no naturally occurring manifest zones to Dal Quor, and even plane shift won’t allow travel there. However, though natural manifest zones don’t exist, anything is possible with an eldritch machine, whether in the hands of the Dreaming Dark pursuing subtle conquest, or simply an eccentric artificer seeking the advancement of arcane science.</p><h1>Coterminous and Remote</h1><p>Ever since the Age of Giants, it’s been nearly impossible to physically interact with Dal Quor from the Material Plane. This forces the quori tied to the kalashtar and the Inspired to act through mortal agents. The only denizens of Dal Quor that can easily enter the world are the fey of the Fading Dream. The plane is always remote; undoing this damage would be an epic quest, potentially returning the thirteenth moon to the sky. But even at a distance, Dal Quor can affect the waking world. The primary way that Dal Quor manifests in the world is through dreams, as described above.</p><h1>Planar Effects</h1><p>Dal Quor is a place where impossible things are possible and the surroundings can change in the blink of an eye. What differentiates it from Kythri and Xoriat is that these changes are drawn from the minds of dreamers, both from the mortal subconscious and the ancient dreams of il-Lashtavar itself. Even when you’re exploring someone else’s dreams, your desires and memories can infect the landscape.</p><h2>Extremely Morphic</h2><p>The environment of Dal Quor can shift at any moment. These changes are generally drawn from the mind of the current dreamer, but the thoughts of adventurers might impact another creature’s dream that they’re currently experiencing.</p><h2>Extended Illusion</h2><p>When a creature casts an illusion spell, its range is doubled; if that spell has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is also doubled.</p><h2>Flowing Time</h2><p>For every 10 minutes that pass in Dal Quor, only 1 minute passes on the Material Plane.</p><h1>The Turning of the Age</h1><p>The layers of Dal Quor are shaped by dreaming minds. The quori believe the heart of Dal Quor is itself the dream of an immense, ancient spirit, and that they themselves are simply part of its dream. They call this the Quor Tarai - the Dream of tthe Age. But there’s a catch: every dream ends when the dreamer wakes up. Forty thousand years ago, the giants of Xen’drik fought a war with Dal Quor - but none of the current quori remember this war or anything that happened before it. They believe this is because the Quor Tarai came to an end. Dal Quor woke from its dream, then immediately returned to its slumber and began to dream again... but it was a new dream, with entirely new quori.</p><p>The quori call this transition the Turning of the Age. They don’t know how many times it’s happened before, and they know nothing about the quori of the previous age. But they believe that each incarnation of the Quor Tarai has its own distinct flavor. The present Quor Tarai is il-Lashtavar, the Great Darkness that Dreams. It’s malevolent and cruel, and that’s reflected by the quori it’s created. But a handful of quori didn’t fit in this dream. These are the quori that became the kalashtar, who consider themselves harbingers of transformation. The kalashtar believe that the next incarnation of the Quor Tarai will be an age of hope and compassion; they call it il-Yannah, the Great Light.</p><p>So all quori know that one day, Dal Quor will wake from its dream, and when it does, all existing quori will be destroyed. This drives the conflict between the kalashtar and the Dreaming Dark. The kalashtar believe their devotions and meditation slowly turn the wheel toward a dream of light. Meanwhile, the agents of the Dreaming Dark believe they can permanently anchor the Quor Tarai in the current age, if only they can control enough mortal dreams - a process begun with Sarlona. If the Turning of tthe Age occurs, all existing quori will be destroyed and reborn; no one knows what this will do to the kalashtar or foreign creations like the Uul Dhakaan.</p><h1>Denizens</h1><p>The quori, children of il-Lashtavar, are the most numerous of the native spirits of Dal Quor. But quori aren’t the only creatures dreamers can encounter in the Region of Dreams.</p><h2>Dreamers</h2><p>At any given moment, there are millions of dreaming minds creating islands in Dal Quor. Humans, orcs, giants, dragons -  any creature that dreams can be found in this plane.</p><p>A rare few dreamers are lucid and in full control of their actions, due to either training or magic; these are capable of leaving their own dreams and moving between the plane’s dream islands and layers. However, the vast majority of dreamers aren’t lucid. They’re driven by their subconscious, and react based on instinct and deep desires; they likely won’t remember the events of a dream clearly. Either way, when a dreamer dies in their dream, they wake up; however, this death can still have consequences.</p><h2>Figments and Drifters</h2><p>When you have a dream and you meet your old drill sergeant, it’s not actually your old drill sergeant, and it’s (probably) not a quori. It’s simply a figment, manifested from the void by Dal Quor. When you wake up - or even just leave the scene - this manifestation vanishes, absorbed back into the essence of the plane. A figment can be anything - a friend of yours, a zombie version of that friend, a demon, a dragon - but the catch is that it’s drawn from the mind of the local dreamer. When you dream about your old drill sergeant, they can’t tell you a secret you don’t already know, because they’re part of you. On the other hand, if you’re in someone else’s dream - or if a quori has taken control of your dream - then the figments can surprise you, because their capabilities and knowledge are drawn from someone else’s mind.</p><p>A figment could use the statistics of the creature it represents, or it might be limited, as the dreamer doesn’t know what it’s actually capable of. Conversely, a figment goblin could have the statistics of an ogre - in this dream, that’s one tough goblin.</p><p>Occasionally, a remarkable figment develops the ability to persist beyond the dream that created it - becoming a truly sentient spirit instead of a simple manifestation. Such figments might be useful guides or allies for mortal dreamers, or become predators that travel from dream to dream and prey on mortal fears. Such free-willed figments are called drifters.</p><h2>The Quori</h2><p>The quori themselves are figments—figments of il-Lashtavar, the current Dream of the Age. However, these figments are immortal, and don’t disappear when a mortal’s dream ends; if they’re destroyed, they’re simply reborn within the heart of il-Lashtavar. Like other figments, they come into existence knowing the role they are supposed to play: they are shapers of nightmares. Each type of quori feeds on a particular emotion; tsucora quori craft terrifying nightmares so they can feast on mortal fear, while the du’ulora thrive on anger.</p><p>When a quori enters a dream, it can create new figments, alter the story’s script, or change its own appearance (though its statistics remain the same). If the invading quori is killed within the dream, the story reverts to the original script, so most quori prefer to remain in the background while shaping a dream; however, some are arrogant and can’t resist playing a starring role. The quori don’t create every nightmare; there are millions of dreamers, while the quori number only in the thousands. But the nightmares they personally create are works of art.</p><p>In the first days of il-Lashtavar, the quori had no purpose aside from preying on mortal dreams. Now they believe they’re fighting for their survival, and they use their abilities to manipulate mortals and the waking world. But always remember that the quori began as crafters of nightmares, and consider how each quori’s favorite emotion may color its actions.</p><h2>Interlopers</h2><p>Some creatures in Dal Quor are neither figments nor mortal dreamers. Night hags freely come and go, collecting nightmares for their own purposes. Here are some other interlopers.</p><h3>The Fey of the Fading Dream</h3><p>Taer Lian Doresh is a feyspire, one of the eladrin cities of Thelanis. Long ago, the tyrant empyrean Cul’sir cursed the feyspire and cast it into Dal Quor. Caught in the transformation of the Quor Tarai, these eladrin became embodiments of classic nightmares, and ease their pain by spreading fear among mortals. Taer Lian Doresh now exists between Dal Quor and the Material Plane. The eladrin of this feyspire can freely pass to both planes, but other creatures can only enter Taer Lian Doresh and return to their plane of origin; they can’t use it as a portal from to the other plane. Thus, quori and adventurers can walk the halls of the Fading Dream together, but the quori can’t cross over to physically enter Eberron itself, nor can the denizens of the Material Plane (including eladrin of other feyspires, humans, and all other creatures of Eberron) enter Dal Quor.</p><h3>The Draconic Eidolon</h3><p>Many dragons of Argonnessen believe they can attain immortality after death, passing through Dolurrh and becoming divine beings. However, some aren’t willing to take that chance; using an eldritch machine hidden deep in Argonnessen, the most powerful can perform a ritual that tethers their spirits to a psychic anchor in Dal Quor. This Draconic Eidolon, a monument in the Ocean of Dreams, holds the souls of dragons long dead instead of releasing them to Dolurrh. The dragons no longer exist physically; like the Undying Court, they’re a union of spirits, possessing greater power together than they would individually. They can’t leave the Eidolon, but possess vast knowledge - secrets of history, insight into the Prophecy, and knowledge of epic magic. They have much to offer, but what do adventurers have that the dreams of dead dragons might want?</p><h1>Layers</h1><p>Dal Quor doesn’t have layers like other planes. Instead, it can be seen as a vast ocean. When a mortal dreams, they fall into that ocean and create an “island”: a dream pocket, shaped by their memories and desires. When they wake, this island disappears. So at any given moment, Dal Quor contains millions of islands, but none last for long. A passive dreamer can’t leave their own island, but a lucid dreamer can find ways to travel between them. Typically this involves portals, doors within a dream that have a psychic connection to the destination - but it’s also possible to break through the psychic border of an island, to fly to another island on a ship of dreams or an imaginary winged beast.</p><p>These flickering islands orbit the stable core of the realm, the dark heart of the Quor Tarai. In addition to the regions discussed below, there may be other permanent islands in the Ocean of Dreams, following the example of the Uul Dhakaan and the Draconic Eidolon. Who created the island, and what sustains it?</p><h2>The Ocean of Dreams</h2><p>A vast expanse of psychic space surrounds il-Lashtavar, home to millions of mortal dreams. The islands in the Ocean of Dreams range from the complex dreamscapes of sentient creatures, humans and dragons alike, to the simple dream of a dog that’s imagining chasing a ball. From the outside, these islands appear as glittering bubbles, each with an image of its dreamer within it. They’re loosely arranged based on the physical location of tthe dreamer, so there’s a stretch of the ocean that contains dreamers near Breland, another for Thrane, and so on - including regions for any dreamers currently on other planes.</p><h2>The Riedran Sea</h2><p>Over centuries, the Inspired have built a network of monoliths in Riedra, psychic anchors called hanbalani altas. These allow them to control everyone’s dreams over a vast radius. Dreams are typically tailored to the region, including local news and instructions. However, if they choose, the Inspired can broadcast a single dream to all of Sarlona. Within Dal Quor, this manifests as a distinctive region of the Ocean of Dreams - an array of hundreds of thousands of islands, dream-bubbles arranged in perfect symmetrical rows, with identical images in each bubble.</p><h2>The Uul Dhakaan</h2><p>Jhazaal Dhakaan united the dar through an act of epic bardic magic. When the dar dream, they don’t create their own islands in the Ocean. Instead, they are drawn to a vast, ongoing dream - the Uul Dhakaan. This is a vision of what the Dhakaani Empire could and should be, and it encompasses many cities and fortresses. In addition to the spirits of dreaming dar, this enormous dream is filled with countless figments—both background soldiers, artisans, and facsimiles of legendary champions whose memories have been preserved. Most dar aren’t lucid dreamers and they don’t fully remember the time they spend in the Uul Dhakaan, but it reinforces Dhakaani values and traditions. If adventurers want to experience what the Dhakaani Empire was at its height - and what it could be again - they can find it here. Chot’uul guardians maintain outposts throughout the dream, along with a great monastery in the capital city. The magic woven into the dream ensures that the throne in the imperial palace remains empty - for now. But when a new emperor is chosen and has the support of the majority of the dar, they’ll hold the throne in the Uul Dhakaan as well as in the Material Plane.</p><h2>Il-Lashtavar</h2><p>The dark heart of Dal Quor, il-Lashtavar, is the current incarnation of the Quor Tarai. This vast dreamscape, orbited by the Ocean of Dreams, is the source and home of the quori. It’s a menagerie of nightmares, a showcase of terrors that haunt the dreams of mortals. On the edges of il-Lashtavar, corpses dangle from the trees of a haunted orchard. Blood drips from the leaves of a terrifying topiary maze. While the basic form of tthese nightmares is stable, they feed on the psyches of nearby mortals. Adventurers walking through the orchard see the hanging corpses as the people they most care about, or even as themselves - whatever is most disturbing to each intruder.</p><p>Those who press through this outer ring of nightmares find the great fortress-city of the Devourer of Dreams, the kalaraq quori who coordinates the actions of the Dreaming Dark on Eberron. The quori spirits tied to agents of the Dreaming Dark and the Inspired can return here whenever they choose, reporting to the Devourer and coordinating with other quori. The flowing time works to their advantage, as an hour in Dal Quor is just a few minutes on Eberron. The fortress itself is ever shifting; it might be formed from black twisted roots, or the walls could be blood-soaked spiderwebs. At the very center is a pool of shadows. It’s here that newborn quori emerge when they’re reincarnated, and here that the Devourer of Dreams descends into the pool to commune with the Great Darkness.</p><p>Il-Lashtavar is the most dangerous place in Dal Quor. At any given time, there are hundreds or even thousands of quori here. The Great Darkness doesn’t act directly, but its presence can be felt in how the environment shifts to showcase the nightmares of intruders. Dreamers who die in this place can be trapped the same way kalaraq bind the souls of their victims. Only the most powerful and prepared adventurers should enter il-Lashtavar.</p><p>In those regions of il-Lashtavar that appear to be outdoors, adventurers may notice a dark, nearly invisible moon in the sky. A sage with considerable skill in History or Arcana may recognize this as the moon Crya, thought to be destroyed in the Age of Giants. Perhaps it was thrown into Dal Quor and could somehow be returned, restoring the plane to its proper orbit - or perhaps this is only il-Lashtavar dreaming of the lost moon.</p><h1>Dal Quor Stories</h1><h2>Familiar Figments, Figment Familiars</h2><p>The adventurers discover their dreams all share the same figure, appearing regularly to each of them. It could be humanoid (a childhood friend, an old mentor), a shapechanging raven, or a talking purple cat. It was once merely a figment of one of their dreams, but it’s become a drifter, able to move between dreams. It could offer advice, carry messages to characters when they’re separated from friends, or warn of things it’s seen in the dreams of their enemies.</p><h2>The Treacherous Whisper</h2><p>A single fortress in the Uul Dhakaan has become infected by a daelkyr curse, turning the figments within it into aberrations. Can this be contained and cleansed before it spreads and destroys the dream itself?</p><h2>The Fortress of the Fading Dream</h2><p>Taer Lian Doresh exists on the edge of Dal Quor, where mortals and quori meet face to face. The tsucora Astaleth has recently turned to the Path of Light and is hiding within the fortress; if she leaves, she’ll be consumed by il-Lashtavar. Can adventurers find a way to save the rebel quori? Why is the leader Shan Lian Doresh allowing her to shelter in his hall?</p><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":700000,"name":"Dolurrh: The Realm of the Dead","type":"text","_id":"EPH8xK3jZFRqgnRB","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><section class=\"traits\"><p>Timeless</p><p>Immeasurable</p></section><hr /><p><strong>Moon </strong>Aryth, the Gateway<br /><strong>Moon and Portal Color</strong> Orange-red<br /><strong>Native Inhabitants</strong> The Quick, the Dead, the Lingering</p><hr /><blockquote><p>Endless caverns stretch throughout Dolurrh, bleak passages of gray stone. Wherever you go, shadowy figures reach toward you, imploring, but you feel only the faintest chill as their insubstantial fingers pass through you. Mist pools around your feet, and as you press forward, you realize this swirling mist is moaning. This is no natural phenomenon; these are the remnants of souls who have forgotten themselves. This is Dolurrh. It’s not the embodiment of the idea of death or dying, both of which are reflected in Mabar. Rather, Dolurrh is where mortal souls go after their bodies die, where memories fade and lives are forgotten.</p></blockquote><p>Mortal spirits are drawn to Dolurrh within moments of death, and their memories begin to decay  immediately. Within days, most spirits no longer have any desire to leave Dolurrh, and within weeks, most only have the faintest memories of their previous lives. The faiths of Aerenal and the Blood of Vol assert that Dolurrh is the absolute end of existence, the last echoes of a life before it’s completely gone. But when Dorius Alyre ir’Korran drew his classic planar map (seen at the beginning of this book), he used the Octogram symbol of the Sovereign Host to represent Dolurrh, because he declared it to be the door through which all mortals must pass to join with the Sovereigns. This has come to be a common view: what appears to be memory fading is actually the soul slowly ascending to a higher form of existence, rising to a level of reality no mortal can experience. The Vassals of the Sovereign Host say the faithful finally join the Sovereigns; followers of the Silver Flame say that noble souls strengthen the Flame. What is left is only a husk—the cast-off remnants, like an abandoned snakeskin or the traces of memory that can be read using speak with dead. Thus, while Dolurrh has long been known as the Realm of the Dead, many call it the Gateway. Ultimately, this is a matter of faith—whether the other side of Dolurrh is oblivion or paradise, no one ever returns from it.</p><p>The sage Annolysse of Arcanix declared that Dolurrh must be the thirteenth plane, for it has no opposite. It doesn’t embody an idea so much as it serves a purpose—that of gathering, collecting, and (perhaps) transitioning souls. Mortal actions are judged in Daanvi; by contrast, Dolurrh doesn’t judge and it doesn’t punish. It’s simply the end of the journey—or depending how you look at it, the beginning of a new one.</p><p>All living creatures come to Dolurrh, sooner or later. Those that come here before death are almost always looking for something—a lost soul, a forgotten memory. But living or dead, any who come to Dolurrh can be trapped by its power.</p><h1>Manifest Zones</h1><p>It is uncommon for a Dolurrh manifest zone to have any of the plane's properties. Despite not manifesting the planar properties, these zones are still frequently haunted and are the source of many ghost stories throughout the world. Despite the haunted nature of these zones, they are not always dangerous or malicious like the Manifest Zones of Mabar. When a zone manifests an effect, it is typically one of the following</p><ul><li><strong>Path of the Dead</strong> Dolurrh manifest zones can act as a gateway into Dolurrh. Sometimes this may require a ritual or sacrifice to activate, or other times it may simply depend on the alignment of the Aryth or Dolurrh being conterminous.</li><li><p><strong>The Way is Shut</strong> When resurrection magic is used in a Dolurrh manifest zone with this effect, it can backfire dangerously</p><table><thead><tr><th>Effect</th><th>Coterminous</th><th>Remote</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1d4 status penalty to the primary check of a resurrection ritual</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>The resurrection ritual is always a critical failure</td><td>no</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>The resurrection is a success, but a creature of Dolurrh also returns with the intended target</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr><tr><td>If the resurrection is a critical success, it is reduced to success instead</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>The level of success of the resurrection is always one step lower</td><td>no</td><td>yes</td></tr></tbody></table></li><li><p><strong>They Will Answer</strong> When resurrection magic is used in a Dolurrh manifest zone with this effect, it can be a boon to bringing the soul back</p><table><thead><tr><th>Effect</th><th>Coterminous</th><th>Remote</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1d4 status bonus to the primary check of a resurrection ritual</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>The resurrection ritual is always a critical success</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr><tr><td>If the resurrection is a critical failure, it is only a failure instead</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>The level of success of the resurrection is always one step higher</td><td>yes</td><td>no</td></tr><tr><td>The material cost of resurrection is halved</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td></tr></tbody></table></li><li><strong>Speaker for the Dead</strong> In these Manifest Zones, anyone can cast the spell Talking Corpse with a casting time of one hour as long as they have a personal connection to the deceased whose corpse they are questioning.</li></ul><h1>Coterminous and Remote</h1><p>Dolurrh has a slow planar cycle. It is coterminous for one year every fifty years, followed by a one-year-long remote period fifty years later. The moon Aryth seems to also affect the Coterminous and Remote phases of the plane and may cause Remote or Coterminous periods out of the regular cycle.</p><p>When Dolurrh is coterminous, ghosts and spirits of Dolurrh are significantly more common - especially near Dolurrh's manifest zones.</p><p>While Dolurrh is remote, resurrection magic outside of Dolurrh's manifest zones always fails. The soul cannot return from Dolurrh, and the only way to raise the dead is by travelling to Dolurrh itself to retrieve the soul. Ghosts are also common when Dolurrh is remote, but rather than being spirits from Dolurrh, it is typically spirits of those who died and were able to resist the pull of Dolurrh - whether from unfinished business or great emotion at the time of death.</p><h1>Planar Effects</h1><p>Everything about Dolurrh is gray and gloomy. Even the brightest colors seem faded, the most joyful sounds seem dull. The heavy weight of ennui settles on travelers the moment they arrive, making even the simplest tasks feel challenging. And there’s a constant pull, tugging on memory and emotion, a desire to just sit down and let it all go.</p><h2>Eternal Ennui</h2><p>When a creature enters Dolurrh, its doomed condition immediately increases to a minimum of 1. While in Dolurrh, your doomed condition cannot be removed or reduced by rest or by any other means - though it can be suppressed. After leaving Dolurrh, the doomed condition fades as normal. Creatures native to Dolurrh are immune to this property’s effects.</p><h2>Impeded Magic</h2><p>To use the Cast a Spell activity for a 1st level or higher spell, a creature must succeed on a flat check of DC 5 + spell level. On a failed check, the action fails and its spell slot is not expended, but the actions are still consumed.</p><h2>Inevitable Entrapment</h2><p>Every 24 hours a living creature spends in Dolurrh, it must make a DC 20 Will saving throw. On a failed save, it increases its doomed condition by 1. For every saving throw made, the DC increases by 1. Creatures native to Dolurrh are immune to this property’s effects.</p><h2>Timeless</h2><p>Time passes at the same rate as on the material plane and is consistent across its layers. Creatures can benefit from resting, suffer damage, and die. However, a creature on Dolurrh doesn’t age and doesn’t need to eat, sleep, or drink.</p><h1>Denizens</h1><p>In many ways, Dolurrh is a machine. The pull that draws spirits to Dolurrh is a mechanical effect, part of the fundamental nature of souls. The denizens of Dolurrh are the cogs of that machine, here to keep the system running.</p><h2>The Quick</h2><p>The native creatures of Dolurrh are bound to the cycle of transition, and all have some role to serve in this process. All of the Quick are immune to the ennui condition.</p><p>Nalfeshnee demons patrol the Catacombs of Dolurrh, dispersing melds and lemures and dealing with mortal intruders. They appear as large humanoids whose features are shrouded in gray mist, and they delight in crushing mortals and pulling the shades from their corpses, as well as consuming lemures.</p><p>Marut inevitables are powerful guardians, crafted in the Crucible of Dolurrh, forged from husksteel, and tasked to preserve the cycle of life and death. Maruts are occasionally dispatched to Eberron to intervene with acts of resurrection, or when a lich or mummy is created. No one’s sure what triggers this deadly intervention—perhaps the resurrection defied the Prophecy—but Jorasco healers always cast augury before raising the dead. If the result is “woe,” they refuse the job, lest a Dolurrhi marut appear, destroying the resurrected creature, its healer, and possibly the whole healing house in the process.</p><p>Shadar-kai are servants of the Queen of the Dead, shades granted new life. Though their new forms appear elf-like, they might’ve been any sort of humanoid in their previous life; when they caught the Queen’s attention, she preserved their soul from entrapment. The shadar-kai serve in the Vault of Memories, and occasionally as her hands on Eberron. They might clash with necromancers (especially the agents of Lady Illmarrow), collect trinkets, or target mortals with no rhyme or reason. Many sages attempt to explain these enigmatic actions, often speculating that they’re collecting especially tragic memories for the Vault.</p><p>Other denizens of Dolurrh are unique, such as the Librarian, found in the Vault of Memories, and the Smith of Souls, who dwells in the Crucible.</p><h2>The Dead</h2><p>The spirits of those who have died are omnipresent in Dolurrh, from shades huddled in the shadows to layers of moaning mist. The Dead might be considered manifestations of Dolurrh, but the plane didn’t actually create them—all were once mortals.</p><p>Shades are mortal souls that are freshly arrived in Dolurrh. They maintain a portion of their memory and original appearance, though they’re insubstantial and can’t interact with material objects. Shades are susceptible to ennui, and as they gain levels, their appearance blurs and their memories slowly fade. Shades can speak, and they may cry or beg adventurers to help them; however, most are incapable of taking any actions on their own. They’re often found lost in thought, trying to remember something they’ve forgotten, or fixating on a past mistake.</p><p>Husks are harmless shades that have been overcome by ennui and possess only the vaguest memories of their mortal existence. Most retain a semblance of their mortal shape, but they continue to fade over decades, eventually merging with other husks to form masses of moaning mist. Having no true consciousness of their own, husks are immune to ennui’s effects. Occasionally, a group of husks cluster around a strong memory, forming an ectoplasmic mass that prowls in search of more scraps of memory, absorbing other husks. Such a creature is called a meld.</p><p>Ghosts are formed when a shade clings to a particular memory with such intensity that even Dolurrh can’t completely eradicate it—perhaps a terrible mistake or a bitter grudge. The rest of the spirit’s memories fade, and it becomes immune to ennui, but this ember remains, defining its existence. Ghosts are driven by a primal desire to return to Eberron, to haunt the place where they died or where their anchoring memory was forged; they might escape to the Material Plane when Dolurrh is coterminous or when a resurrection goes wrong. Ghosts that are destroyed eventually reform; they can only find peace if their unfinished business is resolved.</p><p>Other forms of undead are rarely seen in Dolurrh. The entities found in this plane are the spirits of the dead, slowly fading, transitioning—or trapped in that process. Corporeal undead such as ghouls, skeletons, and zombies have no place here, while undead that hunger to consume life belong in Mabar</p><h2>The Lingering</h2><p>Memories of joy and happiness do no harm in Dolurrh. But memories of pain, of cruelty, of anger... these don’t fade so easily, and they can hurt others. Even if they don’t trap shades as ghosts, this psychic residue can build up in the gears of the spiritual machinery of Dolurrh. It often takes the presence of a mortal to trigger it; when this occurs, the lingering pain and hate coalesces into a solid form. The least of these are lemures, formed from hateful memories or deeds. The emotional residue of hundreds or thousands of people can form deadly sorrowsworn—the Angry, the Hungry, the Lonely, the Lost, and the Wretched. The Lingering are formed in Dolurrh and are immune to ennui, but they’re a waste product, not the plane’s desired result. As such, nalfeshnee, maruts, and other guardians destroy the Lingering whenever they are found.</p><h2>The Queen of the Dead</h2><p>The Queen of the Dead, the most powerful being in Dolurrh, dwells in the great spire that rises up above the Vault of Memories. Little is known about her motives or her origins; curiously, she focuses on the Material Plane far more than most great planar powers do. Though she existed long before the elves, the Queen appears as an elf woman, her face hidden by a cracked alabaster mask, her robes of black feathers trimmed with silver. She can pluck shades from the cycle of entrapment, and even grant them new life, creating shadar-kai by housing them in new bodies. Other souls, she saves but doesn’t restore, preserving them in the Vault of Memories. She collects secrets and memories, plucking her favorites from those gathered by the Librarian and keeping them in her personal collection. Sometimes she directly opposes mortal necromancers, especially Lady Illmarrow. At other times, she seems interested in killing specific people, perhaps so she can preserve their spirits or their memories. But such direct action is extremely rare, remarkable if it occurs more than once in a century; most of the time, she remains silent in Dolurrh, unknown and unknowable.</p><p>Rarely, the bravest (and most foolish) of adventurers venture into the Queen of the Dead’s realm, hoping to reclaim a lost spirit from Dolurrh. And rarely, they succeed, for she doesn’t care if a shade or two are stolen every century, or even every decade. However, in the Age of Giants, the Cul’sir Dominion sent an army into Dolurrh to recover the spirits of a family lost in the Quori Conflict—none of them returned. The Queen’s power cannot be contested in Dolurrh, and thieves who attract her personal attention find their shades torn from their bodies in the blink of an eye.</p><h1>Layers</h1><p>Dolurrh is universally gray and gloomy. The accounts of brave explorers describe the sense of being underground, and no mortal has seen the moon or sky of Dolurrh. Unlike most planes, the layers of Dolurrh don’t embody different ideas; instead, they serve different functions in this grand machine dedicated to processing souls.</p><p>The four layers discussed below are the only ones described in the records of mortals who ventured to Dolurrh—and returned. But there could be more, as yet undiscovered, each likely serving a critical purpose. It’s known that the Librarian has recorded the lives of dragons in the Vault of Memories; accordingly, sages theorize there may be a layer dedicated entirely to the spirits of dragonkind, which may linger longer than the spirits of simple humanoids.</p><h2>The Catacombs</h2><p>Endless tunnels of gray stone wind through the Catacombs, the destination of humanoid spirits. Some passages are painfully tight, while others widen into grand halls with ceilings lost in darkness. The Dead are everywhere, shades pleading for release, husks keening in the shadows. The chambers of the Catacombs might contain vast wells filled with moaning mist, or nalfeshnees herding shades into pens and scraping lemures off the walls.</p><p>The Catacombs may be larger than Khorvaire, or even Eberron itself. A mortal could wander forever through these winding tunnels—at least until they’re consumed by ennui. However, there are junction points that transcend the logic of distance. If one knows the right symbols to follow, they can cross the vastness of the Catacombs quickly or pass to other layers—perhaps in search of a shade to rescue, as discussed in the “Concerning Resurrection” section.</p><h2>The Kennel</h2><p>The Kennel is similar in appearance to the Catacombs, but contains the shades and husks of beasts and monstrosities, along with the nalfeshnee and maruts that tend them. Here, you’ll hear the howls of fading wolf spirits, and see flocks of spectral birds flying through grand halls, along with larger and fiercer creatures. Beast spirits rarely linger long in Dolurrh, as most have fewer memories to erase. But all dogs go to Dolurrh!</p><p>The Queen of the Dead might have created special servants that wander these halls, just as she made the shadar-kai. It’s possible adventurers could be questioned by a clever raven with the soul of a poet.</p><h2>The Crucible</h2><p>In this grand foundry, tended by shadar-kai and guarded by newly forged maruts, the immortal spirit known as the Smith of Souls refines the essence of faded spirits into husksteel. From these lingering scraps of memory and emotion, she forges the armor and weapons of the shadar-kai, and creates the maruts from the husks of brave souls. She also creates smaller and stranger items from husksteel.</p><p>The Smith wears a mask of black steel and an apron of dragonhide. When forging maruts, she takes the form of a giant, and when crafting tiny trinkets, a gnome. It’s possible that she collects the memories of mortal artisans, and can replicate their works at her forge.</p><h2>The Vault of Memories</h2><p>The heart of Dolurrh is the Vault of Memories. This tower, carved up through gray stone, is larger than any of the great towers of Sharn. The lowest levels hold the Vault’s library; here, the spirit known as the Librarian interviews each shade and makes a record of its life. His power is such that an entire life can be confined to a single large page. Every sigil inscribed holds a crucial memory, and if a creature is proficient in Arcana, they can read the symbol to experience that memory. The many floors of the library hold countless books of preserved lives, carefully tended by shadar-kai scribes. The Librarian himself is a massive hooded figure - his books are likewise enormous. It’s said that he can be many places at once, allowing him to speak to every shade, capturing the story of its life, before it fades.</p><p>In the halls above the library, the Queen of the Dead keeps her many treasures. What seem to be obsidian statues are actually shades, crystallized to prevent them from being entrapped and lost in Dolurrh. Paintings and crystals contain memories that the Queen has chosen to isolate. Beyond these are countless trinkets and oddities, items collected by her shadar-kai over the vast scope of history. And higher still are the chambers of the Queen herself, where she usually sits in silent contemplation, listening to the whispers of the countless shades in her domain.</p><h1>Concerning Resurrection</h1><p>Returning life to the dead isn’t a reliable service in Eberron. Many characters are capable of casting the necessary spells, from clerics to adepts of House Jorasco. But just because a spell can be cast doesn’t mean that it should be cast... or that it will work if it does.</p><p>The first and simplest limitation is time. The longer a spirit remains in Dolurrh, the more it falls under the sway of ennui. Any spell that returns life to the dead requires the spirit to want to return. Once the shade becomes a husk, it can no longer make that decision, and thus can’t be raised or reincarnated. Most religions maintain that this happens because the true soul has moved on to a higher level of existence; who wants to be pulled back from a union with the Sovereigns? So you only have about a week or two - depending on the strength of the target’s will - to pull them back. But even before that time, a spirit might choose not to return. What do they have to live for? Is it worth fighting the lulling ennui of Dolurrh?</p><p>The second limitation is risk. Even if a spell is successful, Jorasco remains rightly concerned about whether that person is supposed to come back, or if it’s their time to die - for if it’s the latter, a marut may appear to challenge any resurrection. This is extraordinarily rare, but in part, that’s because healers perform an augury ritual beforehand and refuse to raise someone if there’s a risk. Even if a marut doesn’t intervene, there’s a risk the resurrection could go poorly if Dolurrh is coterminous, perhaps calling back other spirits in addition to - or instead of - the person being brought back to life.</p><p>The final limitation is the direct intervention of a higher power. The Queen of the Dead might crystallize a shade and prevent it from being restored, or catch a spirit that’s about to be restored and set a price on its passage. How long does the beneficiary have to settle their account? A day, a year, a lifetime? It’s also said that the Keeper can snatch souls before they even reach Dolurrh; if this myth is true, such souls can only be recovered from the Lair of the Keeper in the Demon Wastes. The Keeper itself may or may not be there, but it’s certainly the abode of a powerful dracolich!</p><p>The flip side of direct intervention is that the Queen of the Dead (or another powerful entity) might offer to return a shade to life - for a price. This is a way to bring a low-level character back to life, despite their friends being unable to afford resurrection.</p><p>If all else fails, there’s one way you can always bring someone to life: go to Dolurrh, find their shade, and drag it back out to the Material Plane. It’s simple - all you need to do is to locate a single soul in the endless Catacombs (perhaps with the help of a native guide, records in the Vault of Memories, or powerful divination magic), evade Dolurrh’s many guardians, and return to Eberron with the soul in tow. If you succeed, the victim receives a new body, just as if you’d cast true resurrection; and while Dolurrh’s defenders will try to stop you from leaving, they won’t interfere once you return to Eberron. It’s theoretically possible to restore a husk in this way as well, though the resurrected husk generally won’t regain its lost memories, even though it might learn new skills. As a result, it wouldn’t do any good to bring back the Tairnadal ancestors or Galifar I; you could bring a body back to life, but it’s not the original person in any meaningful way. This is why the Queen of the Dead (and perhaps the Keeper) preserves certain shades from decay—so that they might one day be restored, even after thousands of years.</p><h1>Dolurrh Stories</h1><p>Dolurrh can inspire many simple stories through its manifest zones and escaped ghosts. A husksteel trinket could provide a flash of memory that sets the adventurers on a particular path, and finding a way to rescue a shade from the underworld is always an epic tale. Here are a few deeper stories to consider.</p><h2>The Once and Future Queen of the Dead</h2><p>The Queen of the Dead is an enigmatic figure who wields great power in Dolurrh. But there’s another being who uses this title: Erandis Vol, the last heir of the Mark of Death. Through her agents in the Order of the Emerald Claw and beyond, Erandis seeks to restore the power of her dragonmark; no one knows what godlike powers she might wield if she unlocks its full potential. Meanwhile, Dolurrh’s Queen of the Dead seems to oppose Erandis, and often sends her agents - both shadar-kai and adventurers she’s restored to life at a price - to interfere with Vol’s schemes. This could be exactly what it appears; the Queen of the Dead may despise necromancers, and Vol is seeking to depose her. But perhaps there’s more to it. Time works in strange ways when dealing with the planes and beings of vast power. Perhaps the Queen of the Dead isn’t trying to stop Erandis, but guiding her down a very specific path. Perhaps Erandis will become the Queen of the Dead, in which case, she’ll have always been her. Or perhaps that’s what’s supposed to happen, but there’s a way in which it could still go wrong... which could destroy  the Queen of the Dead and throw Dolurrh itself into chaos.</p><h2>Agent of Death</h2><p>The adventurers kill a nefarious villain that’s long eluded them—but soon, their foe reappears alive and well. This happens time and again. How is the villain escaping from Dolurrh? Are they acting as an agent for the Queen of the Dead, or have they simply found a back door to the Realm of the Dead? Either way, what can the adventurers do to lay them to rest once and for all?</p><h2>Devastating Sorrow</h2><p>When Dolurrh becomes coterminous, a powerful sorrowsworn emerges and devastates the region. The adventurers may not have the ability to defeat the sorrowsworn in battle, but if they understand the circumstances of its creation - the emotion that drives it and the event that triggered it - they might be able to disperse the deadly monster by defusing this emotion. When an adventurer touches - or is touched by - one of Dolurrh’s Dead or Lingering, they might sense a flash of any lingering memory or emotion that creature possesses. Can this help them solve the mystery, or will they die in the attempt?</p><h2>The Warforged Soul</h2><p>There are many who believe that warforged are simply tools; House Cannith may be able to infuse something with life, but it can’t create a soul. Others say that it’s not a question of science; the warforged are clearly alive, and thus, they have souls. But is the soul unique? Or could it be that warforged recycle souls, drawing husks drained of memory from Dolurrh and using them as a foundation? But there’s one simple fact: a warforged can be restored to life with revivify or raise dead. Which means that the answer must lie in Dolurrh, and someone - Arcanix? Merrix d’Cannith? The Lord of Blades? - could fund an expedition to find the answer.</p><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":800000,"name":"Fernia: The Sea of Flame","type":"text","_id":"zEkZzYxO9H6Q2EqW","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><section class=\"traits\"><p>Fire</p><p>Immeasureable</p></section><hr /><p><strong>Moon </strong>Eyre, the Anvil<br /><strong>Moon and Portal Color</strong> Silver<br /><strong>Native Inhabitants</strong> Efreet, Dao, Lesser Elementals, Fiends, Celestials</p><hr /><blockquote><p>A massive shard of basalt rises out of a vast ocean of magma. A castle sprawls atop the peak, a glittered fortress sculpted from brass. Firefalls of lava tumble down the edge of the spire. A flight of red dragons takes to the air, circling the castle and creating a dazzling spectacle of synchronized flames.</p><p>Welcome to High Hearth: the party’s about to begin.</p></blockquote><p>It’s simple to say that Fernia embodies the concept of fire. The plane is filled with magma and flame, from massive volcanoes to cities eternally on the verge of being consumed by fire. But Fernia isn’t about mundane fire; Lamannia is the source of simple, natural flame, and holds volcanoes and fire elementals. Rather, Fernia is about all the things we see in the flame, all the ideas it represents. It has layers reflecting wild destruction, where verdant forests eternally burn. It incorporates industry, with legions of azers forever toiling over fire and forge. And it reflects wild passion, burning emotions that can’t be held in, and glorious spectacle; these are the realm of the efreet, the lords of the Sea of Flame, forever striving to outshine their rivals.</p><p>Fire draws the eye and the attention, but where there’s magma, there’s also earth. The azers stand between earth and flame, harvesting the ore they feed to their hungry forges. And in the deep caverns, the dao polish jewels and admire their treasures. Even in these deep layers, the air sears the lungs of creatures that lack the proper protection, but for adventurers willing to brave the flames, wonders and wealth are waiting in the halls of fire and stone.</p><h1>Manifest Zones</h1><p>Manifest zones tied to Fernia often share one or more of the plane’s universal properties. Those with Deadly Heat often have unusual volcanic or tectonic activity, and are generally shunned. However, House Cannith is always searching for Fernian zones with the Fires of Industry property; in addition to providing advantage on tool checks, these zones often allow artificers to craft enchantments that can’t be replicated elsewhere (especially those tied to evocation and flame). A Fernian manifest zone can provide an unexpected haven in an arctic environment, or provide unusual geothermal benefits. In Karrnath, the town of Ember - on the edge of the Icetop Mountains—is renowned for its pleasant climate and thermal pools.</p><p>A Fernia manifest zone typically manifests one or two of the planar effects. In addition, it may have the following additional properties.</p><h2>Continual Flame</h2><p>Motes of continual flame are spontaneously generated in this region, typically attached to some vegetation or minerals from the area. These flames persist even if they are removed from the region.</p><h2>Geothermal</h2><p>The area is dotted with pools of molten earth and fissures of scalding water, from which mephits and elementals emerge with regularity.</p><h1>Coterminous and Remote</h1><p>While Fernia is coterminous, temperatures rise sharply, and warmer regions that would normally be safe can become extremely hot, taking on the Deadly Heat, Empowered Fire, and Burning Bright properties of the plane. During these times, on rare occasions, creatures caught in an area of exceptionally intense flame can find themselves pulled through to Fernia itself.</p><p>When Fernia is remote, intense heat loses some of its bite. Regions of high temperature become one stage lower than normal. In addition, creatures increase their resistance to fire damage by 5.</p><p>Traditionally, Fernia is coterminous once every five years during the month of Lharvion, and it’s remote once every five years during the month of Zarantyr (exactly two and a half years after it’s coterminous).</p><h1>Planar Effects</h1><p>The sweltering heat of Fernia can be deadly to unprotected creatures, and it burns through mortal metabolisms. The following properties apply to the entire plane.</p><h2>Burning Bright</h2><p>When you make a recovery check and you are still dying after applying its effects, make another recovery check.</p><h2>Deadly Heat</h2><p>All regions of Fernia are subject to temperatures of extreme heat (Core Rulebook page 517), though many regions reach temperatures of incredible heat. All creatures increase their resistance to cold damage by 5.</p><h2>Empowered Fire</h2><p>Fire spells are enhanced, while cold and water spells are impeded (Gamemastery Guide page 136). When you Cast a Spell with the fire trait, that spell is automatically heightened 1 level, up to a level equal to the highest spell level you can cast.</p><h2>Fire Energy Ley Line</h2><p>Fernia is attuned to fire energy, and by tapping into this source you can enhance fire spells using that energy’s power. The strength of this power varies throughout Fernia. </p><h2>Fires of Industry</h2><p>When making a crafting check involving the use of fire (such as cooking or smithing), you gain a +2 item bonus to your check.</p><h2>Standard Time</h2><p>Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane and is consistent across its layers.</p><h1>Denizens</h1><p>Fernia is home to celestials and fiends, spirits that embody key concepts of fire and flame. But its primary denizens are elementals of earth and fire. There are no native mortals or manifestations in Fernia: the elemental population is set in stone, and when one elemental dies, a new one takes its place. This can take many forms; new mephits spring out of open flame, while the dao craft new azers out of bronze. But overall, the population is stable; when an efreeti pits two legions of salamanders against one another in a grand display, they know the salamanders will eventually be reborn.</p><h2>Efreet</h2><p>The efreet are the brightest stars in the firmament of Fernia. They are aristocrats, dwelling in sprawling mansions and castles, attended by countless servants, dwelling amidst astonishing opulence. Fire consumes, and the efreet are masters of conspicuous consumption. They are passionate and wild, quick to both anger and joy. They are casually cruel, and can consume or destroy the lives of others even as they celebrate. However, the efreet aren’t conquerors, for they already have everything they could possibly want; their elemental servants exist to serve them, and the efreet consider them to be casually disposable.</p><p>The efreet have been competing with one another since the dawn of time. Passionate arguments can escalate into dramatic duels, and now and again, two efreet unleash their armies in a grand display of fire and burning blood. But by and large, the conflict between the efreet is social, as each strives to outshine their rivals. Efreet society is bound by an elaborate social calendar. At any moment in Fernia, one of the efreet is hosting a grand celebration. Sometimes there’s a theme or explanation for the gala—the unveiling of a new work of art, the epic burning of an old piece of art, or the thousandth anniversary of an efreeti’s last rebirth. Other times, the party needs no explanation.</p><p>If an efreeti isn’t hosting a gala, it’s planning its next one - and always, always searching for ways to outshine every celebration that’s come before. Often this is about working with the resources within the plane, pushing azers and dao to create new wonders. But efreet have vast wealth and the ability to travel the planes, and this can bring them to the Material Plane. If a celebration sports a flight of red dragons performing synchronized pyrotechnics, remember this - dragons aren’t native to Fernia, and the plane doesn’t have manifestations of creatures; thus, the efreeti hired those dragons from another plane. Imagine what it would take to convince dragons of Argonnessen to perform as entertainment! Efreet rarely have any reason to deal with adventurers, but if the characters do have something to offer - or if they’re interesting enough simply to be invited to a party as curiosities - an efreeti can make it worth their time. An efreeti could also serve as the patron of a warlock - perhaps using the Fiend pact - giving the mortal power, but demanding that they always search for things that could give the efreeti an edge over their rivals in their endless social battles.</p><p>While efreet have much to offer, any association with an efreeti is dangerous. They abide by the letter of any contracts they make, but adventurers would be wise to make sure a contract includes safety clauses. After all, efreet are spirits of fire, and they burn the things they touch. They care about nothing save their own status and amusement, and destroy lives without a thought.</p><p>There are a host of noble efreet in Fernia. Here are a few of the most prominent, including their public names they use with mortals—their Ignan names are far longer.</p><ul><li>Sultan Azhalar of High Hearth stands at the top of the social order. He has assembled the grandest armies and enjoys displays of martial might, including exotic engines of war. His galas often involve gladiatorial matches or grand war games.</li><li>Pasha Shashraqa of Firefall stands just below Ashalar in the social order and is determined to unseat her rival. She is cultivating the friendship of several dragons. She considers herself to be a connoisseur of art, and could take an interest in the work of an artistic adventurer.</li><li>Pasha Raqashtar of Gold Ash is the most cosmopolitan of the efreet. He has many friends in the Immeasurable Market of Syrania, and enjoys betting on the outcome of battles in Shavarath. His appetite for gambling could draw the adventurers into his orbit, as he might make a wager with another immortal about the outcome of a particular adventure—then seek to put a burning finger on the scales.</li></ul><h2>Dao</h2><p>Where do the many treasures of efreet come from? Who built their glorious city of brass? The dao are the answer to both of these questions. Azer laborers keep the foundries burning, but it’s the dao who pluck wondrous jewels and pure adamantine from the primal earth, and it’s they who craft the grandest and most remarkable wonders. Each dao has a particular specialty, a unique style of art or artifice. While they can craft artifacts that would be the envy of any mortal artificer, their techniques can’t be easily replicated. Their work has an element of arcane science, but much of what they do involves channeling the essence of Fernia itself; a dao who settles in the Material Plane will find its talents more limited.</p><p>The dao are more stoic than the fiery efreet, and don’t throw extravagant parties. But they still engage in intense social competition with one another, striving to craft the most glorious creations. This doesn’t necessarily mean their work is the most powerful; rather, it’s about creating things that are most desired. The dao don’t need gold, so the efreet usually pay them in barter, which creates a bizarre secondary market. The efreeti Raqashtar might offer a squad of elite salamander warriors in exchange for a wondrous crown; the dao has no use for them, but it knows that the efreeti Azhalar is collecting soldiers, so...</p><p>Adventurers may seek out dao because of what they can do, but dao can also be interesting patrons. A dao may need some rare substance to complete its latest work, but it can only be obtained on the Material Plane—so it turns to adventurers to obtain it. Or a dao could even use a group of mortals as a focus group, seeking opinions on its latest work.</p><p>Here are a few notable dao:</p><ul><li>Naja Ash sculpts fire, producing masterful artifacts and tools that channel or produce flame. She creates the majority of the azer, and she can create other elemental creatures, constructs, or unique blends between the two concepts. She’s the foremost expert on elemental binding in the multiverse, though it would take a great deal to convince her to share her knowledge with mortals.</li><li>Sar Saeran creates tools of war, from personal armor and weapons to grand siege engines. The efreeti Azhalar is his best client, but all of the efreet value his peerless work. He has spent eons trying to create the perfect sword, and often seeks out legendary blades on the Material Plane - sometimes to keep, sometimes to study for a few minutes, and sometimes to destroy.</li><li>Brass is the finest architect of the dao, and is responsible for most of the grand palaces of the efreet. She’s always intrigued by unusual architecture and has visited Sharn a few times to study the towers. She’s also celebrated for her sculptures, and has produced everything from tiny miniatures to towering colossuses, along with magical marvels that begin as the former, then transform into something far larger, like figurines of wondrous power.</li></ul><h2>Lesser Elementals</h2><p>Fernia is home to raw fire and earth elementals (though these can also be found in Lamannia), abstract spirits that want nothing more than to burn or surge. These primordial creatures are largely ignored by the efreet and dao, and they’re driven by pure instinct. Elementals are Fernia’s most common inhabitants; an efreeti wouldn’t be a lord without subjects to lord over, and these lesser elementals serve that role. While humanoid in form, they’re deeply alien, immortal spirits shaped by their element and driven by singular purpose. An azer lives for the forge, and a mephit delights in mischief. Most lesser elementals are content as long as they have the opportunity to pursue their purpose, but occasionally a lesser elemental unexpectedly develops a quirk that drives it to pursue a new purpose.</p><p>The population of these elementals is limited, and thus their service is valuable to the efreet and dao. The efreet and dao often barter the service of their elemental subjects, sending them to allied or rival courts. Typically this doesn’t matter to the elementals, but there have been a few cases of salamanders rebelling against a new lord or mephits playing tricks on their new comrades.</p><p>Azers, mephits, and salamanders are the most common elementals, though others might be encountered somewhere in this plane.</p><h3>Azers </h3><p>The dao craft azers from bronze and bring them to life using the primordial spark of Fernia. They are tireless laborers who love working with fire and metals. Dao may create the greatest wonders, but the azers do remarkable work—and far more of it. Azer are naturally gifted artisans, and can be assigned to any sort of task that involves fire. However, there are few things more miserable than an azer baking bread instead of working with brass.</p><h3>Mephits</h3><p>When encountered in the wilds, mephits are capricious tricksters and their “pranks” can make life miserable for planar travelers. However, those found in the service of the efreet are generally more polite and well mannered—though this can quickly change if there’s an opportunity for mischief too good to pass up.</p><h3>Salamanders</h3><p>The primary servants of the efreet, salamanders can be found serving as soldiers or performing domestic tasks. For every salamander officer carrying an ornate spear, there’s a salamander butler carrying a brass tray. Salamanders are extremely proud, and within their ranks there is great competition over rank and position. Most are dismissive of mortals, but they can be jealous of adventurers who receive too much attention or favor.</p><h2>Fiends and Celestials</h2><p>The fiends and celestials of Fernia embody specific aspects of the concept of fire. Fire is an integral part of their appearance; they may have burning eyes, orange-red skin, or wings and halos formed of flame.</p><h3>Angels</h3><p>Angels represent the comfort fire offers: its life-giving warmth, the light that holds back the shadows. The angels of Fernia are typically devas or other lesser angels, and they generally seek to assist and comfort travelers when they can.</p><h3>Demons</h3><p>Demons reflect the terrifying destructive power of fire, the wildfire that can’t be contained and the spark that brings down a mansion. They are wild and violent, and it’s rarely a good thing when adventurers cross paths with them. Demons yearn to burn all wondrous things. Sometimes this leads them to target the grand mansion of an efreeti, but during coterminous periods, they can also influence untended flames in the Material Plane, or occasionally manipulate mortals into carelessness with fire. Common demons include quasits (malevolent counterparts to the elemental mephits), vrocks with burning wings, and terrifying balors.</p><h3>Devils</h3><p>Devils represent the intentional use of fire as a weapon or to inspire fear—the burning iron used in torture, the screams of those dying on burning battlefields. Devils are rare and exceptionally cruel. They thrive both on causing pain and suffering in Fernia, and cajoling mortals into acts of arson or fiery torture in the Material Plane. Like demons, they can usually only influence mortals when the planes are coterminous, but occasionally a Fernian devil manages to slip through fire into Eberron. Imps, barbed devils, and pit fiends can all be found in Fernia.</p><h1>Layers</h1><p>Fernia is dominated by the vast layer known as the Sea of Flame. Where the sky can be seen, it’s almost always obscured by ash and smoke. Its smaller layers embody specific concepts, such as infernos and campfires. These can usually be reached through burning circles on the islands in the Sea of Fire, or via tunnels in the Deep Halls.</p><h2>The Sea of Fire</h2><p>This is a seemingly endless ocean of magma, larger than any single sea in Eberron. Ultimately, the Sea of Fire wraps around on itself; head north from High Hearth and you’ll eventually find it again, but it may take a month of travel. There are islands in the sea, spires and mesas of basalt and obsidian—some are inhabited, but many are barren and empty.</p><p>Salamanders sail the blazing sea in ships forged from blackened steel, and azers fly over it in balloons woven from brass. Many of the islands hold teleportation circles traced in continual flame, with a word inscribed in Ignan indicating the destination. Any spellcaster with proficiency in Arcana can expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to activate a portal - though unless they speak Ignan, they won’t know where it leads. Here are a few noteworthy destinations.</p><h3>The City of Brass </h3><p>The sole metropolis in Fernia, the City of Brass is the glorious city of the efreet, a place of marvels. Here, a towering statue of an efreeti holds a sphere of continual flame the size of an airship. The statue reshapes itself to match the appearance of the efreeti who currently dominates society; both the statue and whichever efreeti it depicts are known as the Sultan. Currently, the Sultan is Azhalar of High Hearth. All efreet have mansions in the City of Brass, though at any given time, many dwell within their island estates. Likewise, there are always a few dao in residence showing off their latest creations and taking new commissions. The streets are filled with mephits and salamanders. Visiting mortals are a curiosity, but most elementals are too busy to take much time on them. The City of Brass is ringed with teleportation circles, linking it to all of the estates and major foundries.</p><h3>Efreeti Estates</h3><p>Each of the noble efreet have a sprawling palace or mansion on an island in the Sea of Fire. While not so grand as the City of Brass, these estates are studies in opulence, filled with dao-crafted wonders and sculptures of metal and flame.</p><h3>Foundries</h3><p>Foundry islands are models of industry. Some are focused primarily on physical engineering, with vast gears and wheels slowly turning, and chains rising and falling. Others reflect arcane industry, with blazing glyphs and fields of shimmering energy. Here the azers work at all hours, producing both mundane, martial, and magical goods for the efreet and their servants.</p><h3>Deep Halls</h3><p>Under the foundries, tunnels extend down below the Sea of Fire into the earth below. These are the domains of the dao. Like the foundries above them, each has a distinct style tied to the sensibilities of the dao who dwells there. Streams of lava and pools of fire run through the halls, along with veins of metal and minerals. While not as luxurious as the estates of the efreeti, these often showcase the wondrous creations of the dao in residence; adventurers could find a hall whose walls are decorated with a thousand swords, or a brass garden filled with cunning construct songbirds. But some dao are paranoid, and deep halls can also contain a host of powerful and deadly traps</p><h2>Infernos</h2><p>Infernos are isolated layers that showcase a particular act of destruction by fire. One inferno is a burning city, where devils direct bombardment and demons dance about, spreading the flames within. In another layer, a lone balor oversees the devastation of an ancient forest. These fires never end; parts of the layer are rebuilt even as others are consumed, and the inferno continues forever.</p><h2>Campfires</h2><p>These small layers reflect the comfort fire can offer. A campfire layer can be a literal campfire, a lonely light out in the darkest wilderness. Another campfire layer is an inn called the First Hearth, where the angelic barkeep Ashe offers warm drinks around the fireplace from which the inn takes its name. Campfire layers are safe havens, and a perfect place for travelers to rest.</p><h1>Fernian Stories</h1><p>Fernia is difficult to reach and dangerous to visit, but here are a few ideas that might spark adventures related to that plane.</p><h2>The Life of the Party</h2><p>The Pasha Shashraqa of Firefall is determined to unseat the Sultan Azhalar with her next gala. And what’s in fashion at the moment? Adventurers. The Pasha whisks the adventurers to Fernia, promising to reward them well if they make the gala a success—and to throw them into the Sea of Fire should they fail her. Can the characters shine at a party of efreet and dao? Do they know which fork to use, especially when one of them is on fire? What happens when Azhalar’s salamander general challenges a party member to a duel?</p><h2>The Infernal Machine</h2><p>The adventurers stumble across an Emerald Claw camp. These Seekers are working with the dao Sar Saraen, who’s building them a devastating explosive device capable of leveling a city. Can the adventurers find out why Saraean is working with the Emerald Claw? If the dao is being compelled, can they free him? If it’s part of a negotiation, can they make a better offer? And what will they do if they end up with the completed bomb?</p><h2>The Back Door</h2><p>The adventurers find a curious brass key. When inserted into a door, it transforms that door into a portal to the First Hearth, an inn in Fernia. Who does the key belong to? How often can its power be used? The barkeep Ashe is always happy to see a few new faces, but who else will the adventurers meet at the bar?</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":900000,"name":"Irian: The Eternal Dawn","type":"text","_id":"hqUHepKu073GiH0j","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><section class=\"traits\"><p>NG</p><p>Positive</p><p>Immesasurable</p></section><hr /><p><strong>Moon </strong>Barrakas, the Lantern<br /><strong>Moon and Portal Color</strong> Bright Grey<br /><strong>Native Inhabitants</strong> Embers, lumi, celestials, the Architects</p><hr /><blockquote><p>In Irian, birds sing in a fertile valley, while a group of settlers work together to raise their first home. Moving further in, you find the gleaming capital of a new empire, where cheering throngs celebrate in the streets. There are dozens of layers in Irian, and each one is a vision of life triumphant. Irian is the dawn that inevitably banishes even the darkest night, the promise of spring triumphing over the coldest winter. It’s the bastion of hope, the promise that life always find a way.</p></blockquote><p>In his Planar Codex, Dorius Alyre ir’Korran calls Irian the Plane of Light, and indeed, its light is so prevalent that there’s no full darkness within Irian. But it’s also the plane of life, the source of positive energy, the force that sustains life and underlies most healing magic.</p><h1>Manifest Zones</h1><p>Manifest zones tied to Irian are wellsprings of positive energy. Plants and animals thrive in these zones, while people are less likely to dwell on negative emotions and find it easier to embrace hope and joy. Irian zones often have one or more of the plane’s universal properties. Irian zones with the Radiant Power property support spells of healing and may enable rituals or support eldritch machines that can’t be built anywhere else. In particular, the City of the Dead in Aerenal is built on a strong Irian manifest zone, which sustains the deathless councilors.</p><p>Irian zones rarely extend the full swift healing effect of Irian’s Life Triumphant property. However, all of the following benefits are common when in an Irian zone</p><h2>Restorative Springs</h2><p>The waters of a spring hold curative powers - removing disease, healing wounds, even restoring lost senses.</p><h2>Positive Crystals</h2><p>Clusters of radiant crystals sprout from the earth. These crystals typically emanate the Positive Power planar effect, and some particularly potent crystals even replicate the Positive trait of the plane.</p><p>In addition to the above uncommon effects, all Irian manifest zones always have the following effects</p><h2>Positive Influence</h2><p>Plants and animals thrive in these zones, and people are less likely to dwell on negative emotions and find it easier to embrace hope and joy.</p><h2>Healing Guidance</h2><p>You gain a +1 status bonus to all Medicine checks.</p><h2>Upwelling of Life</h2><p>All non-undead creatures gain a +1 status bonus to saves against fear, poison, and disease effects. In addition, when you rest you double the number of hit points you would normally recover.</p><h1>Coterminous and Remote</h1><p>Life blossoms when Irian is coterminous. Health and fertility are enhanced, positive energy flows freely, and living creatures are infused with an abundant sense of hope. While Irian is coterminous, the Positive Power and Upwelling of Life properties apply across Eberron.</p><p>When Irian is remote, colors seem to fade and a sense of psychic numbness pervades the world. All creatures take a -1 status penalty to saving throws against fear. In addition, any effect that restores hit points - including spells - only restores half the total.</p><p>Traditionally, Irian is coterminous for ten days in the month of Eyre and remote for ten days in the month of Sypheros. These effects occur once every three years; the remote cycle comes a year and a half after it is coterminous.</p><h1>Planar Effects</h1><p>The light of the Eternal Dawn strengthens the living. Darkness and disease have no place here, and minor injuries melt away. Irian has the following universal properties.</p><h2>Positive Power</h2><p>Positive spells are enhanced, while negative spells are impeded. When you Cast a Spell with the positive trait, that spell is automatically heightened 1 level, up to a level equal to the highest spell level you can cast.</p><h2>Negative Void</h2><p>To Cast a Spell that deals negative damage, a creature must succeed on a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the actions are lost.</p><h2>Pure Light</h2><p>There is no darkness in Irian. Any spell, effect, or other situation that would usually create darkness instead only reduces the lighting to dim light.</p><h2>Life Triumphant</h2><p>When making a medicine check, you gain a +2 item bonus to your check, and any creature which rests doubles their number of restored hit points. In addition, all non-undead creatures gain a +2 status bonus to saves against fear, poison, and disease effects. In addition, on initiative count 20 a creature with at least 1 hit point regains 1 hit point, and a creature with the dying condition loses the dying condition and becomes stable.</p><h2>Undead Bane</h2><p>Creatures with the undead trait are sickened 2, they may not reduce this sickened value until they escape the effects of Irian. This does not affect undead creatures that are sustained by Irian, such as the deathless elves of Aerenal.</p><h2>Positive Energy Ley Line</h2><p>Irian is attuned to positive energy, and by tapping into this source you can enhance positive spells using that energy’s power. The strength of this power varies throughout Irian.</p><h2>Standard Time</h2><p>Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane and is consistent across its layers.</p><h1>Planar Rebirth</h1><p>Most of the planes are fixed in their form; for example, every mortal brings new dreams to Dal Quor, but the plane’s structure doesn’t change. Mabar is an exception: the Endless Night steals and corrupts fragments of other planes, adding them to its layers. Left unchecked, Mabar would consume reality. But as the Endless Night consumes, the Eternal Dawn creates. Whenever Mabar tears a fragment from another plane, a new planar seed appears in Irian. Initially, this is a small layer, populated by embers and lumi, that has Irian’s planar properties. Over time, the layer grows and evolves, and the environment and its inhabitants take on the appearance of the void it’s to fill. Little by little, it loses the properties of Irian and adopts the properties of its destination plane; when it finally loses the Light of Life property, its ties to Irian are severed and it fully becomes part of the other plane, replacing the region lost to Mabar.</p><p>The planar seed is rarely a perfect match for the fragment that was lost. The embers take the form of local life, but especially for fragments torn from the Material Plane, a planar seed doesn’t replace sentient creatures or buildings; it simply restores land and wildlife. If the Mourning had been the work of Mabar - which is unlikely for many reasons, but not impossible - Irian wouldn’t restore the people killed in the Mourning or the destroyed structures, but it would restore life to the land and make it a welcoming environment.</p><p>In most planes, immortals can’t reproduce, but they’re reborn if they die, and their numbers remain constant. Irian breaks that rule, because it creates new immortals to replace those corrupted by Mabar. These begin as lumi and angels, but as the seed loses its properties, these immortals evolve into the denizens of that plane, drawing their personalities from the template for the new immortals. Irian makes no judgment about the spaces it fills, and it may create a squad of bloodthirsty demons when it replaces a lost fragment of Shavarath. These seed immortals can’t leave their layer until it’s fully bound to their final plane, so they can’t wreak havoc in Irian, but it would be quite a surprise for nosy adventurers that stumble into that layer!</p><p>The creation of seeds is an important drive for the inhabitants of Irian. Immortals monitor and guide the formation of the seeds, while lumi tend the embers and prepare to become inhabitants of the new plane. Irian immortals rarely interfere in other planes, because what they’re already doing is the most important task they could perform.</p><h1>Denizens</h1><p>Most inhabitants of Irian fall into one of the following categories.</p><h2>Embers</h2><p>Irian is bursting with life. Songbirds, rabbits, and other creatures roam the Garden. The streets of the Amaranthine City are filled with happy people. But the Garden never has too many rabbits, and there’s no risk of the citizens of the Amaranthine City starving—or needing to go on strike to prevent it. Sometimes, if you glimpse one out of the corner of your eye, you might see them differently, as an outline of pale white light—a glowing shadow.</p><p>These are manifestations, not living creatures. Called embers, each one is linked to a spark—a tiny echo of a soul, each one tied to a living creature. Through this connection, mortals draw inspiration and hope, and remain linked to the positive energy that flows to and from all living things. An ember resembles the mortal whose spark fuels it, but it isn’t fully conscious and doesn’t have any complete memories, merely echoes of that mortal’s brightest joys, deepest hopes, and greatest deeds. There are many more sparks in Irian than there are embers at any given moment; Irian simply dips into the pool of sparks, manifesting as many embers as the scene calls for, shaping the light of each soul into something that looks like them.</p><p>Embers don’t need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep. They follow basic scripts, but can’t improvise and don’t have much knowledge beyond what they need for their role. As a rule, embers are happy, for they don’t know any other way to be. An ember can’t be truly killed; its body dissolves, but the spark that fueled it remains safely within Irian’s deep well of light.</p><p>While adventuring in Irian, you might see an ember that resembles you—but it won’t recognize you, and might not even appear the same age. This ember is merely your light-shadow, manifested by Irian and channeling your life force. It holds the essence of your best moments and emotions, the light within you that drives you to goodness - but merely as a spark, not the fire of a living creature.</p><h2>Lumi</h2><p>When a mortal dies and their soul goes to Dolurrh, the thread connecting them to Irian is severed. Any ember fueled by their spark dissolves and the spark - the essence of the hopes and brightest moments of the mortal’s life - begins to fade. But the sparks of the dead can merge together before they’re lost completely, creating a new, unique entity - a lumi, formed from the same positive energy as the embers, but possessing true consciousness and life. Unlike the embers, who aren’t fully conscious or aware of the memories they hold, lumi are sentient creatures, each with a unique identity, though their sparks give them fragments of many mortal lives. So adventurers may meet a lumi who recognizes them, and who has a few memories and traits of a fallen friend.</p><p>Lumi appear to be formed from solidified light, and generally take a body shape similar to the strongest of the sparks that formed them - usually those of sentient creatures. Their most distinctive feature is their head - a sphere of light suspended a few inches above their torso. Normally this is pure light, but with conscious effort, a lumi can sculpt and maintain a face. When a lumi dies, its body dissolves and its sparks fade. If an angel of Irian is nearby, it can consume these sparks; this won’t save the lumi, but at least those memories are preserved. While most lumi are humanoids, there may be lumi formed from the sparks of other creatures, like giants or dragons, that dwell in layers of their own kind.</p><p>Lumi serve as the caretakers of the embers, and believe that by helping the embers play their roles, they’re strengthening the light in the mortals the embers are connected to. Lumi help develop and maintain the planar seeds, and some even surrender their identity in order to become new creatures within that seed; they believe that in doing this, they’re sowing the new layer with light. On rare occasions, lumi travel to other planes in service of the Architects. They are brave and compassionate, seeking always to spread hope, and ever prepared to lay down their lives for the greater good. Lumi can defend themselves, but they prefer to inspire others when possible, rather than resort to violence.</p><h2>Celestials</h2><p>Irian’s immortals are spirits of light and hope. Irian is noteworthy for being the home of the ki-rin. These majestic creatures often act as emissaries for the Architects. Each planar seed has a ki-rin assigned to monitor it, help the lumi, and ease transition.</p><p>Irian is also home to angels. Not as violent as the angels of Shavarath or as individualistic as the angels of Syrania, the angels of Irian embody the general principles of hope and compassion. Irian devas assist the lumi and help sustain the different layers; they are the knights and scholars of the Amaranthine City. Devas often change their form to play multiple roles within a layer, and adventurers may think that they’ve encountered multiple people, when in fact it’s a single deva. Meanwhile, planetars act as champions and ministers, and each of the Architects has a single solar that serves as its right hand.</p><p>The angels of Irian have wings formed of light, which they can conceal if they wish. In their true form, they’re luminescent humanoids of indeterminate species, but can choose to appear to mortals as a generic member of the viewer’s species. Devas also possesses the ability to change into specific forms at will.</p><h2>The Architects</h2><p>The Architects are the most powerful spirits of Irian. Each embodies an aspect of the plane, and oversees a region within it, as discussed in the “Layers” section. They’re unique celestials with great wisdom and power, but most of their time and energy is devoted to the planar seeds - guiding the growth of the seed, smoothing over problems, and adding a few personal touches. Planar seeds emerge within an Architect’s realm, expanding until they break off and join their new planes.</p><p>The power of the Architects is largely bound to their realms. They can’t directly intervene in the Material Plane, though they can work with witches (as Celestial patrons) or send lumi. Often this involves the reintegration of a planar seed, or examining regions where Mabar has removed a fragment.</p><h1>Layers</h1><p>It’s always morning in Irian; the skies are clear, the sun is fixed in the sky, and the moon Barrakas is faintly visible. The plane contains many layers, and it’s always growing new ones. While the setting of a layer varies - a verdant valley, a growing city, a newly established farm - the story is always about life, growth, and hope. Things are growing, people are prosperous, and the future is bright. While there are many natural environments in Irian, it’s this optimism that differentiates them from those of Lamannia. Irian is a celebration of life; Lamannia focuses on the untamable primordial power of nature, and often feels more threatening and wild.</p><p>The layers are linked in realms, each of which is bound to one of the Architects. The denizens and themes of a layer reflect the influence of that Architect, so all of the layers of the Garden have a focus on rustic nature, while those tied to the Amaranthine City reflect its rising imperial power. Some layers are bounded by physical barriers, but most either loop back on themselves or end in walls of warm mist - anyone who wanders into the fog reemerges elsewhere in the layer. Within realms, layers are often connected by physical portals like a massive gate or a pool of light. Moving between realms requires plane shift or a ritual tied to that realm. These rituals may not be magical; they are simply secrets that have to be learned. If you’re in the Amaranthine City and you want to travel to the Garden, all you have to do is plant a flower and reflect on its beauty; those thoughts will carry you there.</p><p>Planar seeds sprout from realms. Early on, they’re small layers with indistinct themes, but expand and gradually take on the nature and properties of the plane they’re to become. Thus, you could stumble into a layer that replicates a piece of Dolurrh’s Catacombs or represents conflict in Shavarath. However, these layers aren’t fully developed - once they are, they move onto their destination plane - so Irian’s seed of the Catacombs of Dolurrh won’t have the entrapping effect of Dolurrh itself.</p><p>Here are three examples of realms, but there are many more.</p><h2>The Amaranthine City: Growth</h2><p>This immense metropolis fills an entire layer. The Amaranthine City is the capital of an empire in its first bloom of glory. Gilded banners catch the wind. Armored angels and pegasi patrols pass overhead. People laugh in the streets, healthy and happy. Artisans create a mosaic depicting glorious victories. While this is an empire, the message isn’t about oppression, but one of potential. This is an empire where all the citizens are prosperous and all have equal opportunities. People are proud, the city is full of wonders, and the future is bright.</p><p>The Amaranthine City is widely seen as the heart of Irian. Its Dawn Empress is the first and greatest of the Architects. Her defining principle is growth, the opportunity to reach your full potential, and all layers of her realm reflect this. Her empire isn’t driven by conquest, but rather by exploration - discovering new lands and opportunities, just as mortals can always find new talents within and opportunities beyond. The Dawn Empress is a celestial figure wreathed in light, though she can assume the shape of any humanoid or angel. She presides over festivals and tends the needs of her people, but she spends much of her time focused on the cultivation of her planar seeds. She occasionally works with mortals, typically warlocks; while she may have missions tied to planar seeds or to clashing with agents of Mabar, she also gives her agents tasks that are designed to help them with their own growth and evolution.</p><p>Layers tied to the Amaranthine City reflect its theme of expansion and discovery. These layers may hold outposts in otherwise-uninhabited lands filled with wonders of nature, or they might hold prosperous farms and estates, inhabited by embers, with lumi and devas helping to drive the theme.</p><h2>The Garden: Life</h2><p>The Garden lives up to its name; it’s a vast zoological garden filled with foliage. It contains every plant that can be found in the Material Plane, along with many that can’t. There are winding paths, peaceful pools, wondrous topiaries, and complicated hedge mazes. In contrast to the wilds of Lamannia, this is very carefully cultivated. The Garden is suffused with a sense of peace, beauty, and the wondrous things life can create.</p><p>The Garden is the realm of the Gardener, an Architect whose principle is life. He’s a blend of angel and plant - more humanoid than treant, but with skin of bark, a beard of leaves, and a crown of flowers. Like all of the Architects, he’s devoted to his planar seeds, but he also spends time wandering the garden, both tending it and appreciating its wonders. He appreciates those who nurture and heal others, and this is the behavior he expects of any mortals he associates with.</p><p>The many layers of the Garden realm showcase various elements of fertility and the triumph of life. There are a few layers that are slightly darker than the rest of Irian, though still suffused with dim light in their darkest corners - these reflect the principle that life overcomes hardship. The message of the ruined castle isn’t to dwell on the destruction, but to see the flowers blooming on the walls. Most of the embers in the region take animal form, and ki-rin are the most common celestials.</p><h2>The Refuge: Hope</h2><p>The Refuge is a vast fortress-monastery, though it has aspects of a spa as well. It’s filled with tranquil groves, soothing baths, and places to rest and reflect. The fortress walls don’t represent potential conflict, but rather speak to the absolute security of the place - within its walls, you are safe from all threats. The Refuge holds healers who can treat your injuries, mediators who can talk through problems, and sages who may not know the answers you need, but can point you in the right direction. This isn’t a place where adventures occur; it’s where you recover from your injuries and plan your next move, knowing that you’re safe and that there are answers to every problem.</p><p>Araam is the Architect of the Refuge and embodies the concept of hope. She’s a wise advisor, and while she may not always have answers, she helps people look at their problems in new ways and see that all problems can be solved. She’s the finest healer in Irian, and there are few injuries she cannot heal or curses she cannot break. There’s no monetary cost for the services of the Refuge, but Araam charges those who benefit to give hope to someone who needs it; they won’t be allowed to return to the Refuge until that debt is paid. While Araam isn’t a god, a Life cleric could say that their class features come from training in the Refuge and are tied to the power of Irian.</p><p>While not all layers of Araam’s realm provide the security and succor of the Refuge itself, they all can provide comfort and hope. They don’t have the absolute peace of Syrania, but they make people feel there’s hope. Irian has no match for the Immeasurable Market of Syrania, so if you’re looking for commerce, the Azure Sky has more options. But for adventurers who seek a relaxing vacation in the planes, the Refuge is unparalleled.</p><h1>Irian Stories</h1><p>At first glance, Irian can seem much too good to be true. Its inhabitants are benevolent, and it heals you every round. What’s the catch?</p><p>At the most basic level, there isn’t a catch. It’s the literal embodiment of light triumphing over darkness and the power of hope. While certain diseases could be seen as tied to the concept of growth, Irian doesn’t have a dark side in the same way as, for example, Daanvi. However, there are a few obvious limitations. It’s not an easy plane to reach, as its manifest zones don’t act as portals. So the Refuge is a perfect shelter for anyone who can reach it, but you have to find a way to get there. And with the Refuge in particular, you get one free visit, but after that, Araam expects you to help someone else before she’ll welcome you again.</p><p>There are a few ideas you can explore. The first is that unfounded hope can be dangerous. A lumi or deva might spread hope because that’s its nature - but in doing so, may convince people they have a chance to defeat an enemy that they should actually be fleeing from. You can also explore mortal forces abusing the power of Irian - Jorasco seizing a manifest zone to grow Araam’s crown or criminals trafficking in fool’s hope.</p><h2>A Wound That Will Not Heal</h2><p>Perhaps a villain wields a Mabaran scythe that deals wounds that can’t be healed by magic or rest, or a hag lays a terrible curse on an adventurer. It’s said that all wounds and woes can be cured in the Refuge of Irian. But how will the adventurers reach the Eternal Dawn, and what will Araam ask of them in return?</p><h2>Beyond the Grave</h2><p>When the adventurers cross paths with a lumi, it hails them. It holds the memory of a hero who once saved the life of one of the characters, and that debt was never repaid; the lumi asks them to honor that by helping with its current quest. This could be a debt incurred during the party’s travels, or even something from a character’s backstory; you could ask a player to tell you about a time someone saved their character’s life, and let them add depth to the debt.</p><h2>A New Realm</h2><p>A barren region on the border of two nations or rival clans suddenly becomes a wondrous, fertile oasis. This is the result of a planar seed taking root. In addition to whatever remarkable plants or resources it holds, it’s become an Irian manifest zone - a valuable resource. Dispute over the territory could have disastrous consequences; can the adventurers prevent bloodshed? And has the Architect hidden any secrets or artifacts in this seed land?</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1000000,"name":"Kythri: The Churning Chaos","type":"text","_id":"ykn43Halct5G11RB","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><section class=\"traits\"><p>CN</p><p>Erratic</p><p>metamorphic</p><p>Immeasureable</p></section><hr /><p>Moon Zarantyr, the Storm<br />Moon and Portal Color Pearly white<br />Native Inhabitants Wild things, Slaadi, Githzerai</p><hr /><blockquote><p>It’s hard to keep a consistent rhythm in Kythri. It takes effort to maintain any pattern of behavior; without even thinking about it, people in Kythri adjust their behavior to avoid repetition. This is the essence of Kythri. On the one hand it’s a vision of chaos, but it’s also about change, adapting to overcome the  unexpected, and challenging traditions.</p></blockquote><p>Kythri is commonly imagined as utterly unstable, with landscapes taking shape only to boil away within moments. And this is true of the heart of the realm, known as the Sea of Chaos. But at the edges of the sea, there are islands that linger. The environments of these Shifting Islands steadily and constantly change; a vast desert might be a lush rainforest in a few hours. But the land itself remains constant, and creatures can live on these islands, adapting to the endlessly changing environment. While Kythri constantly changes, its elements are usually natural. A jungle becomes a desert, a blizzard becomes a sandstorm - but it’s comprised of sand, not tiny marble busts of King Boranel. This distinguishes Kythri from Xoriat or Dal Quor; while constantly changing, it’s generally change between plausible options, unlike the unreal environments of the Realm of Madness and the Region of Dreams.</p><h1>Manifest Zones</h1><p>Kythrian manifest zones are often unpredictable in minor ways. Weather patterns may deviate from the surrounding region and change on a moment’s notice. The plane’s universal properties also carry over to many manifest zones. Any Kythrian zone with the Constant Change property might produce monstrosities. A zone with the Fluid in Form property amplifies the effects of transmutation magic and can have dramatic effects on the success of magebreeding; these zones are extraordinarily valuable to House Vadalis.</p><p>Manifest zones can occasionally serve as gateways, allowing creatures from Kythri to slip through into Eberron, intentionally or accidentally. Many monstrosities make their home in the wilds, whereas other creatures—like slaadi—can present very unusual encounters, depending what culture they’re from</p><h1>Coterminous and Remote</h1><p>Kythri’s cycle of coterminous and remote periods is completely unpredictable, lasting anywhere from days to centuries. However, neither coterminous nor remote periods have any discernable effect on Eberron.</p><h1>Planar Effects</h1><p>All things change in Kythri, even time and the future. The only thing that’s truly reliable is that nothing’s reliable.</p><h2>Broken Rhythms</h2><p>You may not use the same action twice in one turn. If you used a specific action on your previous turn, you take a -2 status penalty to use the action again this turn.</p><h2>Fluid in Form</h2><p>When a creature casts a transmutation spell, its range is doubled; if that spell has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is also doubled.</p><h2>Embrace the Unknown</h2><p>To use the Cast a Spell activity for a 1st level or higher Divination spell, a creature must succeed on a flat check of DC 5 + spell level. On a failed check, the action fails and its spell slot is not expended, but the actions are still consumed. Divination spells cast on other planes can’t affect or target creatures, places, or objects on Kythri.</p><h2>The Odds Are Odd</h2><p>When you roll a check, you critically succeed if you beat the DC by 5 or more. If you fail the DC by 5 or more, you critically fail instead.</p><h2>Constant Change</h2><p>Every 24 hours spent in Kythri, some minor or major aspect of your character changes. This could be the colour of your clothing, the colour of your hair, or your gender. This aspect is determined by each player.</p><h2>Chaotic Time</h2><p>Time is fluid in Kythri, inconsistent both with the Material Plane and within its islands. When returning to the material plane, a random amount of time has passed.</p><h1>Denizens</h1><p>Most of Kythri’s denizens fall into one of three categories</p><h2>Wild Things</h2><p>The islands of Kythri are inhabited. But how can a creature survive in an environment that can be a desert today and a glacier tomorrow? The answer, of course, is that the creature must change with the environment. Kythri’s islands include some creatures that appear to be natural beasts, though they change as the region around them does; the wolf in the forest becomes an arctic wolf when the land turns into a glacier, and turns into a jackal when it’s a desert. Even beyond their practical changes for survival, Kythrian creatures might be constantly shifting their plumage, behavior, and more fundamental biology, whether from moment to moment or day to day.</p><p>However, not all of Kythri’s wild things transform into familiar forms. Part of the plane’s core concept is evolving in response to change, and Kythri is home to many creatures that blend the features of two or more natural beasts: monstrosities such as the owlbear, griffon, and chimera. It’s commonly accepted that at least some of these monstrosities first appeared in Kythri, and that they first appeared in Eberron either by passing through portals or due to the influence of manifest zones.</p><p>Just as the environments of Kythri are chaotic but largely blend natural elements, Kythrian monstrosities typically blend the forms of natural creatures. While there are hippogriffs and griffons in Kythri, inherently alien creatures like kruthiks and gricks aren’t found here. The wild things of Kythri also include natural shapechangers, notably a wide variety of mimics - even colossal ones that can assume the shape of natural features such as hills or mountains. It’s quite likely the mimics of Eberron either immigrated from Kythri or were created by its influence, much like the sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion use the blood of the kar’lassa bound to Kythri to create their plasmids.</p><p>Unlike other planes where these wild things would likely be manifestations, the wild things of Kythri are mortal creatures. They live, reproduce, and die following (mostly) natural means, and have to find sustenance and shelter in their islands. Between the strange flow of time and unusual environments, this can lead to dramatic surges in populations or sudden extinctions. However, the plane itself seeds new life into islands that somehow become depopulated, and if all the griffons in Kythri were to die, new ones would eventually evolve. So even though Kythri doesn’t have manifestations, it ensures a steady  stream of mortals exist—and when they die, it replaces them.</p><h2>Slaadi</h2><p>The slaadi are native immortals of Kythri. Though they do reproduce (in strange and disturbing ways) and can die of mortal ailments, they’re defined as immortals because their population remains constant. Whenever a new slaad is born - whatever the method of its creation - an existing slaad dies, seemingly at random. And whenever a slaad is killed, a new one is formed. So while they seem to share many of the traits of mortals, they can never be wiped out even if they die en masse, and even if a blue slaad transforms a village of humans into slaadi with the chaos phage, the overall number of slaadi doesn’t increase.</p><p>The slaadi are the only native civilization of Kythri. They aren’t a monolithic society; some live in massive cities, while others are tiny rustic communities. Each slaad community has its own distinct culture and a grand name, and the Slaad Cultures table provides a few examples of these - but there are many more, and they’re constantly changing. The grand city of Cornerstone may be the seat of the brutal Concordance of Iron today, and the Enlightened Lyceum League a month later. These changes are astonishingly fast, but they aren’t instant; there are usually at least a few days of chaotic transition and revolution in between a change. The scope of a community won’t change - Cornerstone is always a metropolis, while Turn is always a village - but the structures of the community shift. Under the Concordance of Iron, Cornerstone is filled with brutalist iron towers, while the Cornerstone of the Lyceum League is filled with slender glass spires.</p><p>The slaadi themselves retain their core forms while their buildings and government change. Red slaadi are always red toad-like creatures that implant eggs, but the Lyceum slaadi might be tall and slender, while the Concordance slaadi are squat and heavy. Kythri’s influence can also cause slaadi to change color. So slaadi follow standard methods for creating particular colors - a blue slaad infects creatures with chaos phage, creating red or green slaadi - but a green slaad could go to sleep one night and wake up as a death slaad, and vice versa. In a culture like the Concordance, that means leadership frequently changes, because it’s based on color, not personality.</p><p>Because slaad cultures change so rapidly, they rarely enact plans beyond their own communities, though cities occasionally clash. Some weeks they seek to exterminate the githzerai, and other weeks, to ally with them. You never know what you’ll get.</p><h2>Githzerai</h2><p>The githzerai aren’t natives of Kythri, and their presence is an act of defiance: through unparalleled mental discipline, they create bastions of order in the heart of chaos. If they seek order, why don’t they dwell in Daanvi? It’s not that they simply desire order, but to strengthen their will by imposing it on a reality that absolutely defies it. The struggle is the purpose. Beyond this, they’re served by the fact that even great powers can’t scry into Kythri. The “Eberron and the Gith” sidebar explains how the githzerai came to Kythri and what they seek to accomplish.</p><p>The githzerai don’t dwell on the Shifting Islands of Kythri. Instead, they’ve created their own islands in the Sea of Chaos: vast monastery vessels the size of small towns, moving through the eddies of chaos and defying transformation. The githzerai devote themselves to meditation and self-improvement, with little interest in what transpires beyond their monasteries. They have no particular love of outsiders - they consider all creatures of Eberron to be warped shadows of their stolen reality - but neither are they inherently hostile. A persuasive group of adventurers could find brief shelter in a githzerai monastery, especially if they bring something interesting to trade or have compelling stories to share. However, should the outsiders offend the githzerai, they’ll feel no remorse in eliminating them; there’s nothing evil in shining light to dispel a shadow.</p><h2>Greater Powers?</h2><p>No one knows if there’s a greater power shaping Kythri. The death slaadi are powerful beings, but there’s no known equivalent to Dolurrh’s Queen of the Dead or Dal Quor’s il-Lashtavar. Some sages assert that there must be a consciousness at the heart of the Sea of Chaos, a sentience behind the chaos, but if so, its presence has never been proven.</p><h1>Eberron and the Gith</h1><p>Long ago, a proud empire was crushed by the daelkyr. But this wasn’t the Empire of Dhakaan, but a nation of gifted psychics who lived in towers of crysteel and sentira. Dyrrn the Corruptor transformed their champions into the first illithids, using them as living weapons to subjugate their own people. When defeat was inevitable, the great leader Gith led a planar exodus, fleeing into Kythri. The Churning Chaos hid the refugees from pursuit, and through absolute discipline, they imposed stability upon chaos.</p><p>Once the refugees regained their strength, a bitter divide split their people. Zerthimon the Wise maintained that the people of Gith should remain within Kythri. He believed mental discipline was the ultimate key to victory and that, in time, they could gain the power to reclaim their reality. But Gith was a warrior, and her followers yearned for battle. They wanted to build their strength and resources by raiding every layer of reality until they found a way to destroy Xoriat.</p><p>This situation remains today. The githzerai dwell in their monastery vessels in Kythri, gaining strength through the endless imposition of order upon chaos. The githyanki dwell in vast fortress-ships the size of cities, anchored in the trackless wastes of the Astral Plane, but their raiders can attack any plane. They slaughter devils in Shavarath and pillage the grand galas of Fernia. At any time, a githyanki warship could attack a major city in Khorvaire; it’s up to the DM if this has ever happened before, or if the githyanki have left Eberron alone. Alternately, a githyanki merchant could be a recurring NPC, showing up and offering items pillaged from across the planes. Where the githzerai are serene and disciplined, the githyanki are passionate and aggressive. All gith despise the daelkyr and slaughter illithids whenever they can, and they could be curious and unexpected allies against a cult of the Dragon Below.</p><p>Hearing this tale, one might well ask: where are the gith from? They’re from Eberron - but not the Eberron that exists today. They came from a world surrounded by the Ring of Siberys, but there were no humans or elves on their Eberron. According to the githzerai, when the daelkyr completed their work on Eberron, they wiped the gith world from existence and created a new reality. If this is true, they may have done this countless times... and if they break the Gatekeeper seals, they could do it again. What the githzerai ultimately hope to achieve is to reassert their reality onto the Material Plane.</p><p>It’s possible that the gith are deluded about all of this. Even if the gith myth is true, it’s doubtful the githzerai will ever have the strength to rewrite reality. But can it be entirely dismissed? Note that the draconic allies of the githyanki are descended from dragons from the gith Eberron; they have no loyalty to Argonnessen, and could be a curious wild card.</p><p>Time moves strangely in Kythri and the Astral Plane, and the gith could’ve been dwelling in Kythri and raiding reality for thousands of years - or it could be that from their perspective, the destruction of reality was barely a century ago. Are the githyanki led by an ancient lich-queen, or by Gith herself?</p><h1>Layers</h1><p>Unlike many planes, Kythri isn’t divided into layers. Its structure is closer to that of Dal Quor; it has a planar core, with islands of reality suspended within the Sea of Chaos. The difference is that the core of Dal Quor is stable - while in Kythri, the closer you get to the heart of the sea, the more tumultuous it becomes.</p><p>There are many slaad communities spread across the Shifting Islands, and at least half a dozen githzerai monastery vessels in the Sea of Chaos. Cornerstone and Zertherun IV are examples that can be used as inspiration.</p><h2>The Sea of Chaos</h2><p>Space has little meaning in the Sea of Chaos. Matter, distance, and gravity are in constant flux. Lands and creatures appear and dissolve within moments. There are waves of lightning, streams of lava, and hurricane winds constantly shifting direction. While the elements may be mundane - unlike the surreal vistas of Xoriat - size has little meaning. A thousandfoot-long dragon turtle might appear, try to swallow travelers, then become an island.</p><p>Travel through the Sea of Chaos is driven by pure will. Travelers must impose the concept of motion and distance on the environment using great mental focus, while also protecting their vessel from both the destructive forces and from being transformed. To successfully travel, the adventurers must know where they want to go; without a destination to serve as a conceptual anchor, they’ll quickly crash on a random Shifting Island.</p><h2>The Shifting Islands</h2><p>There are countless islands on the edge of the Sea of Chaos, varying dramatically in size, each with its own environment. These are constantly changing, but they change slowly; it can take anywhere from a day to a week for an island to shift from a barren desert to a verdant jungle. Weather is generally more dynamic, and often at odds with the environment; a vast desert can suddenly face a dramatic blizzard. </p><p>The primary denizens of the Shifting Islands are monstrosities and beasts that blend the features of multiple creatures. Populations expand and contract, and don’t have to be sustainable, so adventurers could find a plateau filled with griffons, or a realm of chimeras where each one has a different arrangement of heads. The intelligent inhabitants of the island are almost entirely slaadi, but they aren’t necessarily hostile. </p><h2>Cornerstone</h2><p>Cornerstone is the largest of the slaad cities. Its architectural style and precise layout are constantly changing, but it’s always a sprawling city that houses hundreds of thousands of slaadi. If Cornerstone is held by the Concordance of Iron, it has vast armies drilling (though their tactics and units constantly shift). If it’s under the influence of the Final Regency, there are immense temples and countless shrines to the slaadi interpretation of the Sovereigns. The Random Settlements tables of the Dungeon Master’s Guide can be useful here to determine specific attributes of the current incarnation.</p><p>The attitude of slaadi toward adventurers depends on the active culture. The Final Regency may welcome adventurers who profess devotion to the Sovereigns, provided they don’t question the Regency interpretation. The Confluence of Reality celebrates extraplanar visitors, desiring their stories and performances. Meanwhile, the Cornerstone of the Glorious Union of Flesh is a very dangerous place to visit! Regardless, Cornerstone is the best place to acquire Kythrian artifacts or magical services</p><h2>Zertherun IV</h2><p>Zertherun IV is one of the monastery vessels of the githzerai. It’s under the guidance of the Serene Azera, whose mental discipline maintains the stability of the ship. The Alazerth Elemon is a senior monk charged with dealing with outsiders, which is sometimes a matter of diplomatic negotiations, and other tims, rallying zerths to defend the vessel from attack. Like most githzerai, Elemon isn’t inherently hostile toward outsiders, but has no great love for them; his reaction is based entirely on the actions and approach of the visitors.</p><p>Kythri’s Broken Rhythms and The Odds Are Odd properties don’t apply in a githzerai monastery, and while Constant Change exists, its effects are minimized. Zertherun IV maintains capacitors for change, such as gardens of small stones and engraved wheels with shifting patterns, which absorb the energies of change and prevent it from transforming the vessel.</p><h1>Kythrian Stories</h1><p>Visitors from Kythri can cause excitement, and an accidental journey to a Shifting Island can be an easy source of adventure; can the adventurers find a way back before they are consumed by the Churning Chaos? Here are a few other ideas.</p><h2>Vadalis Park</h2><p>The dragonmarked houses are looking for new sources of revenue in the wake of the Last War. Jalan d’Vadalis, a brilliant magebreeder, has created a resort where people can interact with a vast array of intriguing monstrosities, including a few of his own design. This park is built on a Kythrian manifest zone, and Jalan hasn’t yet recognized that the Constant Change property is sabotaging his security systems and dangerously mutating his monstrosities. He was so preoccupied with whether he could do it, he didn’t stop to think whether he should... </p><h2>Terror at Sea</h2><p>While at sea, the adventurers pass through a Kythrian manifest zone at exactly the wrong time, and a blue or red slaadi from the Union of Flesh slips aboard the ship. It infects or implants a few passengers, doing its best to hide. Can the adventurers defeat this lurking threat before it’s too late? Or will a wave of newborn slaadi take over the ship?</p><h2>Superstars</h2><p>A gray slaad reveals its presence to the adventurers. It’s from the Confluence of Reality and wants to bring the adventurers to Cornerstone to represent their cultures. What could go wrong? Well, while the Confluence is usually peaceful, this time it wants the adventurers to represent their culture in a massive extraplanar gladiatorial match. Can they defeat champions from across Eberron and the other planes? Or is the only hope of survival to flee into the Sea of Chaos and try to find another way home?</p><h2>The Hunt</h2><p>The adventurers stumble into a pitched battle: a trio of githzerai ambushed by Transcendent Flesh cultists. Only one survives the battle. This zerth has a psychic connection to the illithid master of the cult cell, and is determined to bring down this mind flayer. Will the adventurers work with the zerth and end this threat? And is this solely about the hunt, or does the githzerai have a hidden agenda?</p><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1100000,"name":"Lamannia: The Twilight Forest","type":"text","_id":"X5EeAJ7j6h1O6Sey","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><section class=\"traits\"><p>Immeasurable</p></section><hr /><p><strong>Moon </strong>Olarune, the Sentinel<br /><strong>Moon and Portal Color</strong> Pale orange<br /><strong>Native Inhabitants</strong> Beasts, Elementals, Humanoids</p><hr /><blockquote><p>Lamannia embodies primordial nature, untapped and untamable. It’s often called the Twilight Forest, and is depicted as a realm of colossal trees and massive beasts. However, the forest is just one of the facets of Lamannia. Every natural environment is represented in various layers that exemplify and exaggerate their features. Windswept desert, raging ocean, endless plains - all can be found here. In other planes, these environments are backdrops to the story the realm is telling. In Lamannia, the environment is the story. It doesn’t need the help of fey or fiends to make its point, because the land itself is the point.</p></blockquote><p>Some scholars assert that Lamannia served as a blueprint for the Material Plane - that here, the Progenitors perfected the ideas of storm and stone. They believe that the natural world is infused with the essence of Lamannia, and that druids and others who wield primal magic actually manipulate that Lamannian essence. And indeed, druids who travel to the Twilight Forest can be overwhelmed by the sheer force of nature that infuses this place.</p><p>Lamannia lies close to the world, and it’s one of the easiest planes to reach. Its treasures are natural objects imbued with elemental power - wood, stone, herbs, and plants, all of which are stronger and more potent than their mortal counterparts. But when you come to Lamannia, there are many predators, and you are prey; anyone who seeks to despoil the embodiment of nature will be hunted.</p><h1>Manifest Zones</h1><p>Lamannian manifest zones are relatively common, and usually share one or more of the plane’s universal properties. They’re often found at the heart of a region that resembles the connected layer; zones tied to the Endless Ocean are found underwater, while manifest zones tied to the Twilight Forest can be found in the Towering Wood, the King’s Forest, and other vast woodlands. It’s relatively common for these zones to serve as gateways to Lamannia, though they might require a lunar alignment or a coterminous period. This goes in reverse too, as creatures can be pulled through to the Material Plane, from hostile elementals to deadly megafauna.</p><p>Zilargo has a number of valuable zones with the Elemental Power property, and House Cannith and the Twelve are eager to find more of these zones - though they’re also dangerous, as elementals sometimes spontaneously manifest in such places, linger for a few hours, then dissipate. Bound elementals can also break free from their bonds in some Lamannian manifest zones—especially unfortunate if that elemental is responsible for keeping an airship aloft!</p><p>Plants and beasts near Lamannian zones often are significantly larger and healthier than their counterparts in other areas, and many House Vadalis enclaves are built in these zones. Zones with the Primordial Matter property can also be a valuable resource for communities, with purified food and water and the presence of extremely durable wood and other materials for industry. The prison of Dreadhold is built in such a manifest zone.</p><p>However, though Lamannian manifest zones can be useful tools for communities and dragonmarked houses, some zones actively resist and repel civilization. Weather, vegetation, and a rapid rate of decay can combine to quickly destroy structures built in the zone and overgrow the ruins.</p><h1>Coterminous and Remote</h1><p>While Lamannia is coterminous, the effects of Lamannian manifest zones are enhanced. In regions of unspoiled nature - such as the Eldeen Reaches and the wilds of Q’barra - fertility of both plants and animals is enhanced, and beasts conceived in these periods are often exceptionally strong and healthy. Spells that target beasts or elementals are extended; if a spell has a duration of 1 minute or longer, the duration is doubled; spells with a duration of 24 hours or more are unaffected.</p><p>While Lamannia is remote, fertility rates drop, and beasts born in these periods are often weak or sickly. Animals are often uneasy, and the duration of spells that affect beasts or elementals are cut in half, to a minimum duration of one round.</p><p>Lamannia traditionally becomes coterminous for a week around the summer solstice, and is remote for a week during the winter solstice.</p><h1>Planar Effects</h1><p>Lamannia is a reflection of the natural world, intensified and exaggerated. The air is pure and clean, the water fresh and clear. Colors are impossibly vivid. It’s suffused with life - a realm in which any stone could be an earth elemental, where any tree could be awakened. Vegetation is nearly always in bloom, and beasts are almost always in the peak of health. Except for a few layers such as the Rot, Lamannia reflects the ideal state of the natural world. Here are some of the plane’s consistent properties.</p><h2>Indomitable Beasts</h2><p>Creatures with the animals, beasts, or elemental trait gain a +2 status bonus to Fortitude and Will saves. Upon its arrival in Lamannia, any elemental or beast that’s under the effects of an enchantment spell or bound in any way may choose to immediately end the effect.</p><h2>Primal Power</h2><p>When you Cast a Spell on the primal list, that spell is automatically heightened 1 level, up to a level equal to the highest spell level you can cast.</p><h2>The Land Provides</h2><p>You gain a +2 status bonus to all Survival checks.</p><h2>Primordial Matter</h2><p>It’s difficult to destroy or contaminate the matter of Lamannia. All nonmagical food and drink are purified and rendered free of poison and disease. In addition, natural materials such as wood and stone are tougher than their mundane counterparts. All objects made of Lamannian materials increase their hardness by 5.</p><h2>Standard Time</h2><p>Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane and is consistent across its layers.</p><h1>Denizens</h1><p>A common story about Lamannia tells of an explorer who passed through a manifest zone and found herself on a vast mountain peak. Pressing up the mountain, she was exploring a mysterious thicket when she was set upon by rats the size of wolves. She fought the rats, but was on the verge of being overwhelmed... until a giant beak flashed down and snapped up a rat in a single bite. The wide “thicket” wasn’t natural briar; it was the nest of a gargantuan roc, one of Lamannia’s many impressive denizens.</p><h2>Beasts</h2><p>Lamannia’s primary inhabitants are beasts - both ones that you might encounter in the wilds of Eberron, and massive creatures that can be seen as iconic representations of their type: the idealized incarnation of Bear or Wolf. Any natural creature can be found in Lamannia; indeed, some sages assert that the presence of a creature in Lamannia is what defines it as “natural.”</p><p>For the most part, Lamannian beasts are no smarter than their counterparts on Eberron. However, some animals possess intelligence similar to that granted by the awaken spell, though even these beasts generally follow their natural instincts and live wild lives. While the giant owls of Sharn may own shops and run for city council, the giant owls of Lamannia are content to hunt the beasts of the Twilight Forest. So it’s possible to find creatures in Lamannia that speak Common or a Primordial dialect, but most have little interest in long conversations.</p><p>The beasts of Lamannia generally fall into the following four categories.</p><h3>Mundane Animals</h3><p>Mundane animals are identical to their counterparts in Eberron. Any natural creature can be found in a layer with an appropriate environment. If such beasts are the first things adventurers encounter in a visit to Lamannia, they might not even realize they’ve traveled to another plane.</p><h3>Dire Animals</h3><p>Dire animals are creatures of remarkable size. Such creatures are more common than mundane animals; in the Twilight Forest, most owls are giant owls, and they prey on giant weasels and rats. Any natural beast could have a dire counterpart in Lamannia.</p><h3>Megafauna</h3><p>Megafauna are gargantuan beasts. The roc is an example of Lamannian megafauna; those found in Eberron have been drawn through manifest zones or slipped between planes during coterminous periods. There are a wide range of megafauna; a pack of gargantuan wolves could hound the adventurers, or they might meet a megafauna serpent that uses the statistics of a purple worm - perhaps even a megafauna dinosaur! While these creatures are similar in form to beasts, they are typically classified as monstrosities. Between their vast size and their connection to the plane, they’re immune to most effects that target beasts, and you can’t charm a roc with a simple animal friendship spell.</p><h3>Totems </h3><p>Totems are beasts that are beyond the tactical scale - creatures that can be measured in miles. The gnome explorer Tasker tells a tale of an island in the Endless Ocean that turned out to be an enormous turtle; another of his stories features a pack of lycanthropes living in the fur of a massive roaming wolf. Such totems aren’t natural creatures and don’t need to eat. Their origins and purpose are unsolved mysteries, but most sages believe that they are immortal spirits projected by the plane itself. Some claim that the totems are connected to all creatures cast in their image. Others believe that the totems are sources of primal power, and barbarians, shifters, and druids can receive power and guidance from them. All that’s known for sure is that they’re immune to common spells, and there are no accounts of anyone successfully harming or communicating with a totem.</p><h2>Elementals</h2><p>After beasts, the most common inhabitants of the plane are elementals. Unlike the genies, mephits, and anthropomorphic elementals of Fernia and Syrania, Lamannia’s elementals are the pure, living essence of the elements, unburdened by any humanoid desire. These include the standard earth, fire, air, and water elementals, but they can come in a wide array of sizes and forms. Adventurers exploring the Broken Lands could encounter tiny globs of lava crawling across the land, while the leviathans of the Endless Ocean and the elder tempests of the First Storm are forces of apocalyptic power.</p><p>The Zil gnomes commonly summon and bind the elementals of Lamannia, using them to propel lightning rails and airships. While intelligent, these elementals are utterly alien. They have little concept of time and perceive the world purely through the balance of elements. The sole desire of most elementals is to express their element: to burn, to flow, to fly. Many have an antagonistic attitude toward spirits of other elements, which drives the deadly conflict between them in the Broken Land—this poses an obstacle in dealing with elementals, as they tend to perceive humanoids as globs of water. While it’s possible for a character that speaks Primordial to talk with a Lamannian elemental, it’s usually difficult to establish any sort of common basis for negotiation. Still, there are legends of wandering druids who “befriended earth and air,” so anything is possible!</p><h2>Humanoids</h2><p>There are merfolk in Eberron - such as the Kalamer of the Thunder Sea—but their people began in the Endless Ocean of Lamannia, and are still found there. These primordial merfolk remain close to their elemental roots and instincts. They wield druidic magic, but don’t craft tools or structures. Other humanoid natives of Lamannia are much the same; any race with a strong primal connection could be tied to Lamannia, but they’re driven by instinct and avoid the trappings of civilization. There could be tabaxi dwelling in the branches of the Twilight Forest, but if so, they’ll seem wild.</p><p>Over a century ago, during the Silver Crusade, there were many lycanthropes who fled to Lamannia. As long as they remain on this plane, a lycanthrope can’t spread the curse to anyone other than their offspring, and the unnatural impulses of the curse - the drive to prey on innocents, the bloodlust that can cause a victim of lycanthropy to lose control of their actions - are suspended. Meanwhile, primal instincts are amplified; Lamannian werewolves remain predators and take joy in the hunt, but they aren’t driven to evil, and remain in full control. Packs and communities of lycanthropes are scattered across the layers. Most are descended from lycanthropes who fled Eberron to escape both the templars and the dark power whose corrupting influence led to the crusade; these shapeshifters embrace their primal nature and rarely assume humanoid forms. But there are also packs descended from afflicted templars who chose exile over death, and who strive to preserve the beliefs and traditions of their ancestors.</p><p>A handful of druids and rangers have crossed into Lamannia and chosen to remain in this primal paradise. Many run with lycanthrope packs, embracing their feral instincts and spending their days in wild shape. Others act as planar shepherds, seeking to minimize the impact of dangerous manifest zones and help unwary travelers.</p><h2>Greater Powers?</h2><p>There are no celestials or fiends in Lamannia. Yet explorers often report a feeling that they are being watched, and there are times when random events seem to be guided by an unseen hand. When outsiders have sought to establish industries in Lamannia, they’ve been attacked by megafauna or elder elementals, or struck by especially vicious turns of weather. It’s possible that this is the work of the totems, and that they have great influence over their layers. Or there could be a greater power that watches over the entire plane. Some scholars assert that the moon Olarune is the consciousness that governs the plane, and Eldeen shifter traditions that predate the practices of the Wardens of the Wood also reflect this belief. Shifter druids suggest that Olarune created the shifters, and the first lycanthropes were her champions.</p><h1>Layers</h1><p>Each of Lamannia’s layers highlights a particular aspect of primal nature. One layer in Lamannia might contain a single colossal mountain peak; on the other hand, the Twilight Forest could be as large as Khorvaire (or even Eberron itself). The edge of a layer could be an impassable physical barrier, or it could wrap around onto itself - if you sail far enough in the Endless Ocean, you’ll find yourself back where you began. Most layers of Lamannia follow a traditional day-night cycle, though they aren’t synchronized across layers, and when the moon Olarune is visible, it’s always full.</p><p>The portals that connect the layers of Lamannia often only allow travel in one direction. Any deep pool of water may connect a layer to the Endless Ocean; but while you can get to the Ocean by diving into a pond in the Twilight Forest, there’s no gate back to the forest on the other side. The Endless Ocean contains small islands, and if you explore one, you’ll find you’ve moved to a new layer.</p><p>The following are just a handful of Lamannia’s many layers. In creating a layer, think of a distinctive natural feature - a canyon, a desert, a lone mountain - and build the layer around it. What creatures would be found there? Have any outsiders taken up residence? Is there an unusual role for elementals? How does it connect to other layers or Eberron?</p><h2>The Twilight Forest</h2><p>The sky is hidden by the dense canopy of this vast rainforest, leaving the forest floor in an endless twilight. The trees are over a hundred feet in height - impressive, certainly, though not as tall as the greatpines of the Towering Wood in the Eldeen Reaches. But as people further explore the Twilight Forest, they come upon strange ridges and walls of wood, some forming twisted wooden canyons. Following these, explorers discover they’re the roots of unimaginably colossal trees, vast titans wider and taller than the towers of Sharn. The Twilight Forest as mortals experience it lies in the shadow of the grander canopy that rises far above it, and these enormous trees are home to megafauna and mightier beings.</p><p>Though the Twilight Forest is wild and untamed, explorers can find wide cleared paths through the lower forest. Survival experts may recognize that these aren’t trails created by humanoid hands; rather, they’re the paths of totems, who have crushed the lesser forest beneath their colossal feet. The forest is filled with beasts - mundane and dire creatures in the lower forests, megafauna in the grand canopy above it, and the occasional passage of totems. There are multiple communities of lycanthropes scattered throughout the lower forest. A clan of wererats have carved out a warren in the roots of a colossal tree, while a pack of wild wereboars feuds with werewolves descended from exiled templars. An ancient elf druid named Haral, who spends most of her time in the form of an owl, does her best to maintain order; she is assisted in this by a megafauna owl she calls Ruark.</p><p>The forest has many other inhabitants, and a few minor elementals can be found in this layer. A gust of wind, a pool of water, a rolling stone - in Lamannia, any of these things could be alive.</p><h2>The Broken Land</h2><p>The Broken Land is a volcanic region filled with high mountains and lava plains. There are constant eruptions, and the layer is home to many fire and earth elementals that engage in an ongoing environmental conflict. Fire elementals flow out with the lava as volcanoes erupt; earth elementals work to contain the eruptions and to rebuild the shattered peaks, only to have them erupt again. Few beasts manage to thrive in this layer, but some tough dinosaurs have clawed out a niche. While this region has fewer connections to Eberron than the Twilight Forest, it’s also possible to find remnants of other travelers here; it’s a harsh and deadly landscape for stranded adventurers or for those who seek a lost relic from this place.</p><h2>The Endless Ocean</h2><p>This layer reflects the majesty of the ocean depths. It’s home to a vast array of fish and aquatic beasts, along with merfolk tribes and a wide range of water elementals, from simple sentient currents and weirds to massive leviathans and battling megafauna. The Endless Ocean is where the gnome Tasker encountered an island that turned out to be a totem turtle. True islands are few and far between, and most are actually portals to other layers of Lamannia. There are many points in the Endless Ocean tied to manifest zones (most located in ocean depths) in the Material Plane.</p><h2>The First Storm</h2><p>A layer of plains and low hills, this region is permanently lashed by hurricane winds and endless storms. Beasts huddle in caves and the limited shelter, while all manner of elementals clash in the storm-lashed plains. A massive elder tempest drives the heart of the storm; during the Sundering of Sarlona, an apocalyptic cult in Ohr Kaluun sought to bring this elemental to Eberron, believing it would destroy the world.</p><h2>The Rot</h2><p>Decay is part of nature, and this is reflected in the swamp-like Rot, a relatively small layer filled with fallen, rotting trees. Corpses of megafauna beasts lie scattered around the layer, and giant insects and other massive scavengers prey on their remains. There’s a community of wererats thriving in the Rot, and there could be a small outpost of the Children of Winter who found their way here. While the Rot is a symbol of death and decay, it’s entirely natural, and undead have no place here. It’s possible a necromancer could arrive here, hoping to animate the massive corpses; however, this would violate the theme of the plane, and if there’s any higher power at work in Lamannia, it would certainly direct forces to counter this. While most layers of Lamannia are free from disease, disease itself is part of nature; a manifest zone tied to the Rot could spread plagues into the surrounding region.</p><h2>Titan’s Folly</h2><p>Lamannia is filled with precious natural resources; it’s hardly surprising that an advanced civilization would try to harvest them. During the Age of Giants, the Group of Eleven set up a research station and mining camp in a layer of Lamannia. After a decade struggling against megafauna attacks and elemental-enhanced weather, the outpost was finally overwhelmed and abandoned. It’s a testament to the arcane engineering of the giants that anything remains of this structure... although it may be that it remains because the ruin itself has become a symbol of nature reclaiming civilization. Vines and moss cover shattered walls, and the bones of giants are scattered throughout the remnants of this garrison. Valuable and powerful treasures may well be hidden in the Folly, but explorers will have to contend with aggressive elementals, dangerous beasts, and traps left by the long-dead giants themselves.</p><h1>Lamannian Stories</h1><p>Lamannia is a source of elementals and dire beasts. It’s wild and untamed, strengthening primal magic and providing a haven to lycanthropes. It resists any intrusion by civilization. Here are a few ideas for working it into your story.</p><h2>A Savage Land</h2><p>When a party of adventurers unknowingly passes through a Lamannian gateway, they must find a way to survive in this wild realm. This could be as simple as finding another manifest zone to take them home, or it could require them to survive in Lamannia for months while waiting for the planes to become coterminous. Or perhaps their airship passes through a manifest zone and the elemental breaks free; the adventurers are stranded, along with other survivors.</p><h2>Megafauna Island</h2><p>An island near a Lamannian manifest zone is discovered to be the home to an unusual array of megafauna beasts. Adventurers could stumble onto this on their own, or they could be hired by an heir of House Vadalis who wants to investigate the rumors without drawing the attention of rivals in the house. Perhaps the adventurers find a legendary megafauna ape—which, if captured, might break free while on exhibition and climb the towers of Sharn</p><h2>At War with Nature </h2><p>An Ashbound druid manages to establish a new Lamannian manifest zone in a major city, such as Fairhaven or Sharn. It’s causing the city to crumble, releasing elementals and dense vegetation as the wilderness takes over. Can the adventurers find a way to remove the manifest zone?</p><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1200000,"name":"Mabar: The Endless Night","type":"text","_id":"bH4MIMqEvtuvgcNt","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><section class=\"traits\"><p>NE</p><p>Negative</p><p>Shadow</p><p>Immeasurable</p></section><hr /><p><strong>Moon </strong>Syperos, the Shadow<br /><strong>Moon and Portal Color</strong> Smoky grey and shadowy<br /><strong>Native Inhabitants</strong> Shadows, Yugoloths and other Immortals, Undead, Dark Powers, Hostages</p><hr /><blockquote><p>A sea of liquid shadows laps against black sands and basalt cliffs. A skull lies half-buried in the sand, empty sockets gazing into the roiling mist. The bone isn’t sun-bleached, for there is no sun here - only a faint glimmer from the smoky gray moon that hangs in the sky.</p></blockquote><p>Early scholars studying reports of Mabar concluded that it was the Plane of Darkness - that this physical property is its defining concept. However, the plane’s eternal gloom is just a symptom of its true nature. Even the brightest day eventually ends in darkness, and Mabar embodies this idea. It’s the shadow that surrounds every island of light, patiently waiting to consume it. It’s entropy, despair, and loss. This isn’t the place where the souls of the living go after death, but rather, it’s the plane of death itself—the hunger that consumes both light and life.</p><p>Mabar is the source of negative energy, and the origin of most undead. Manifest zones - and most undead - tied to Mabar consume the life force from the world around them. However, some people maintain that negative energy itself is just a tool, and that the power of Mabar can be harnessed for good.</p><h1>Manifest Zones</h1><p>Mabaran manifest zones are infamous and almost universally shunned, for nearly all are harmful to the flora and fauna of the region. In some zones, life withers and dies. In others, it’s twisted in strange ways; plants may seek the blood of living creatures, or grow unnaturally pale and cold. Rot and decay are often accelerated, and disease can thrive. However, such regions are also often powerful sources of negative energy. Mabaran zones often possess the Necrotic Power universal property, and there are epic rituals and eldritch machines that require a Mabaran manifest zone. The Odakyr Rites that create Karrnathi undead are an example of this, and the Karrnathi city of Atur is built on a Mabaran zone. This often has a curious synergy: if the negative energy of a Mabaran manifest zone is regularly channeled into rituals or spells, it prevents that energy from spreading disease or killing vegetation. In his War and Death: A History of Karrnathi Necromancy, Jolan Hass Holan asserts that the plagues and famines Karrnath suffered early in the war were due to the Seekers who normally tended those zones being pushed out of them due to strategic concerns— which, in turn, forced Karrnath to embrace necromancy to counter the effects of those famines.</p><p>While Mabaran manifest zones rarely serve as gateways to the plane, they are powerful sources of negative energy and produce undead. Skeletons, zombies, and ghouls can all spontaneously rise in Mabaran manifest zones, and more powerful undead can be created under the proper circumstances.</p><h1>Coterminous and Remote</h1><p>On nights when Mabar is coterminous, the Necrotic Power property encompasses the entire world, and the radius of all light sources are halved. During these periods, regions of deepest darkness can serve as gateways to Mabar, releasing shadows or other foul things into the world. This primarily occurs in regions that are suffused with despair or misery, and only at night, ending as soon as dawn breaks. As a result, during coterminous periods, friends and family usually huddle together indoors, keeping the lights burning and telling cheerful tales.</p><p>When Mabar is remote, all creatures increase their resistance to negative damage by 5.</p><p>Traditionally, Mabar is coterminous for three nights in the month of Vult—the nights of the new moon closest to the winter solstice. The people of the Five Nations call this time Long Shadows. Mabar is remote less frequently, for a period of five days around the summer solstice, but only once every five years.</p><h1>Planar Effects</h1><p>The Endless Night consumes life and light. It’s a wellspring of necrotic energy, where light is swallowed by gloom, and unprotected creatures quickly die. Mabar has the following universal properties.</p><h2>Necrotic Power</h2><p>Negative energy is the very essance of Mabar. As such, the following adjustments apply while within its borders:</p><ul><li><p>Negative spells are enhanced</p></li><li><p>Positive spells are impeded</p></li><li><p>When you Cast a Spell with the negative trait, that spell is automatically heightened 1 level, up to a level equal to the highest spell level you can cast.</p></li><li><p>All of Mabar is considered to have a Negative Energy Ley Line, as per the rules in Secrets of Magic. The strength of this power varies throughout Mabar.</p></li></ul><h2>Radiant Void </h2><p>To Cast a Spell that deals positive damage, a creature must succeed on a flat check with a DC equal to 5 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the actions are lost.</p><h2>Eternal Shadows</h2><p>There is no light in Mabar. Any spell, effect, or other situation that would usually create bright light instead only increases the lighting to dim light.</p><h2>The Hunger of Mabar</h2><p>Mabar consumes the life force of living things and produces the following effects:</p><ul><li><p>Every round a living creature spends in Mabar, it takes 1d6 points of negative damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it immediately dies and its body crumbles into ash. Natives of Mabar and creatures under the effects of a death ward spell are immune to the effects of this property.</p></li><li><p>Creatures without the undead trait are sickened 2, they may not reduce this sickened value until they escape the effects of Mabar. This does not affect creatures that are sustained by Mabar.</p></li></ul><h2>Standard Time</h2><p>Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane and is consistent across its layers.</p><h1>The Consuming Darkness</h1><p>The planes don’t usually interact with one another. The armies of Shavarath endlessly battle each other; they don’t lay siege to Xoriat. Each plane is an isolated, perfect vision of a particular concept. But the concept that defines Mabar is the hunger to consume all light and life, along with the inevitable downfall of all things. When the proper forces align, Mabar pulls fragments of other planes into the Endless Night; over time, these are drained of light and hope and transformed into new layers of Mabar.</p><p>Initially, these captured planar fragments become part of the Hinterlands and night falls in the region, but they don’t yet have any of Mabar’s universal properties. Over time, the fragment’s properties from its previous plane are replaced by the properties of Mabar. Once the fragment acquires the last property in this process, the Hunger of Mabar, it’s fully assimilated into the Endless Night as a new symbol of entropy and despair. Mortal inhabitants of the fragment are typically transformed into shadows or other forms of undead, while immortals might become yugoloths, or twisted into dark mockeries of their former selves. The conversion is slow and inevitable, and the Dark Powers of Mabar don’t have to take any action - but regardless, most enjoy tormenting the fragments. Undead prey on the edges of fragments besieged by the Bone King, and yugoloth soldiers raid fragments claimed by the Empress of Shadows.</p><p>As an example of a converted fragment, consider the Drifting Citadel. This floating tower was once a library in Syrania. Now it drifts through an icy void, grand windows shattered and books fallen from their shelves. Shadows of sages clutch at books with insubstantial fingers, never able to turn a page. The angelic librarians have become tormented spirits who hunger for knowledge, draining the memories from any creature unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp.</p><p>At times, the great powers of other planes have tried to stop Mabar from capturing fragments of other planes - but to no avail. The darkness can’t be stopped, as it’s part of the machinery of reality - the Endless Night consumes and fragments are lost. Those pulled into the darkness can fight against it, but the ultimate outcome is inevitable. Were it not for Irian, Mabar would eventually consume everything. But as the Night consumes, the Dawn restores, and so balance is ultimately maintained.</p><p>The process of consumption is slow and ongoing, and there are always multiple fragments in the Hinterlands. It may take Mabar months, years, or even centuries to consume a fragment. As the properties are replaced, the landscape of the fragment changes to reflect it. In a former fragment of Lamannia, the vegetation around the borders begins to wilt. Creatures become sickly, and totems may not be seen at all, or they might be terrifying shadows, killing the grass they walk on.</p><p>Mabar typically targets other planes, but it can claim pieces of the Material Plane as well. This initial effect is reminiscent of the Mourning; gray fog rolls over the region that’s affected, and all that’s caught within the fog is lost. However, Mabar typically claims a region the size of a town, or perhaps a county; it’s never been known to claim an entire country. Typically the fog fades within a day, leaving a barren region stripped of vegetation and structures. Mabar’s power is such that it also consumes the memories of the place; most mortals simply forget that the affected region ever was anything but barren, and forget the people consumed in the process. This process isn’t perfect or absolute, but when contradictory information is presented, people instinctively try to rationalize it. Maybe they heard a story about the lost town? The uncle who lived in that town? Didn’t he die in the war? In short, player characters might  realize something is wrong, but be unable to convince others of it. Because of this magical effect and the fact that it happens so rarely, the common people of Khorvaire don’t know about this aspect of Mabar. But if a group of strong-willed player characters investigates it, they might be able to discover the cause of lost colonies and other mysteries.</p><h1>Denizens</h1><p>From shadows of mortal souls to Mabar’s Dark Powers, the Endless Night’s inhabitants all embody aspects of darkness, despair, and death. The plane’s denizens fall into these five general categories.</p><h2>Shadows</h2><p>Shadows are the most numerous inhabitants of Mabar. These semi-sentient spirits linger in places where you might expect to find people, forlornly pantomiming the roles of the absent inhabitants. You’ll find the shadows of children playing on the corner of a Mabaran street, and the shadow of a priest silently praying to an absent and unknown god in a shattered temple. In his Planar Codex, Dorius Alyre ir’Korran asserts that every mortal has a shadow in Mabar, much like the conscripts of Shavarath; this theory is supported by the shadow-gardeners of the Amaranthine City. However, the shadows of Mabar don’t speak, and they’re driven by impulse and instinct; if they’re tied to living creatures, they’re just a dark sliver of each soul. The shadows hunger for the lifeforce of mortals, but they ignore creatures that have resistance or immunity to necrotic damage or that are shielded by the death ward spell</p><h2>Yugoloths and Other Immortals</h2><p>The immortals of Mabar are spirits of darkness. The yugoloths - embodiments of hunger, despair, and death - are the citizens of a vast empire centered on the Amaranthine City, most serving as soldiers. In the Hinterlands, yugoloths battle celestials and fiends trapped in these doomed fragments, until the fragments are ultimately fully drained, assimilated, and their immortal inhabitants converted to a form more suited to the Endless Night. It’s questionable if these battles actually speed up the assimilation, or if they’re simply a way for the yugoloths to pass the time. If there are no immortals to battle, the yugoloths simply spread despair; an oinoloth may spread plague through a fragment of the Material Plane, then spend a year watching the result.</p><p>Some yugoloths are gardeners, but what they cultivate are shadows. By shaping a mortal’s shadow, a fiend can fill that mortal with despair or drive them down dark paths. When the associated mortal eventually dies, the yugoloth can refine that shadow into quintessence; this substance is crafted by yugoloth artists and artisans into tools and weapons that can cause death and despair, should they make their way to the mortal world. While most gardeners work with shadows, some go into the fragments of the Hinterlands to directly torment the hostages in slow and subtle ways. Other yugoloths are philosophers and oracles who contemplate the nature of entropy and the way in which all things will end. And some serve menial roles in the Amaranthine City.</p><p>The yugoloths make up the majority of the immortals of Mabar, but there are others. Mabaran incubi and succubi embody emotional pain and loss. Some prey on hostages in fragments, while others live alongside the yugoloths and ply their wiles on them; the suffering of a fiend is just as satisfying to them as that of a mortal. Other incubi and succubi are gardeners, and some believe that these can drain the love from a mortal heart by bleeding it from their shadow. There are also immortals from other fragments that have been transformed - angels and devils reshaped by the Endless Night.</p><h2>Undead</h2><p>Mabar is the origin of most undead. Sentient undead are created when a dying creature’s soul is bound to Mabar instead of passing to Dolurrh. The energy of Mabar sustains the creature - be it wraith, mummy, or vampire - while the creature serves as a conduit to the Endless Night. This is why many undead directly consume the life force of other creatures. Even those who don’t do so directly may drain life from the world simply by existing; this is why plants are often withered in areas frequented by the undead. Likewise, this connection to Mabar has a corrupting effect that pulls most intelligent undead toward evil alignments. Even people who were good in life find that Mabar erodes their empathy and compassion; it’s a struggle to maintain your humanity when your existence is bound to the Endless Night.</p><p>There are also many undead in Mabar itself. Many of these are merely symbolic manifestations of Mabar, not actually the remains of mortal beings; the endless skeletal armies of the Bone King are manifestations and the Bone King himself was likely never mortal. Specters and wraiths are especially powerful shadows; some are the work of gardeners, while others emerge from the pure darkness of Mabar. The more desolate planes, like the Obsidian Desert, are ruled by nightwalkers, powerful conduits of negative energy; they often attack fragments, feeding on the energy of the fragment and accelerating its assimilation.</p><p>Beyond this, the souls of sentient undead are bound to Mabar. When a vampire, mummy, lich, or similar creature is physically destroyed, it doesn’t get the release of Dolurrh; instead, the soul becomes a wraith in Mabar, forever driven by the hunger of the Endless Night. Most are driven mad by this process, but perhaps the adventurers might once again encounter a vampire they previously killed, now a spectral lord in the Endless Night.</p><h2>The Dark Powers</h2><p>The mightiest and most malevolent beings in Mabar are known as the Dark Powers. Each embodies a particular aspect of Mabar and rules a domain of linked layers. Some have been part of Mabar since the beginning of time, while others have risen from the fragments consumed by the Endless Night. Most of the Dark Powers are equivalent in power to archfey or archfiends, though they’re even stronger in the layer they’re bound to, their seat of power. However, they have a limited ability to act beyond Mabar, and can only affect the Material Plane through warlocks or undead servants. Three of the Dark Powers that are known on Eberron are described later in this section, but there are many more in the shadows.</p><h2>Hostages</h2><p>The fragments in the Hinterlands hold all the creatures that dwelled in each before they were captured. When a mortal dies there, they return as a shadow or undead. Immortals are bound to their fragment; they can’t leave it, and if they die, they’re reborn there. So creatures from any plane could be found here, including the Material Plane. A chunk of Risia might hold frost giants. A fragment of the Endless Ocean might have a pod of merfolk. But the longer they remain in Mabar, the more the plane corrupts the fragment and the creatures in it, until they become shadows, undead, or something worse. A mortal creature that lives through this process may have all the light drained from its soul or be consumed by despair. While it might retain its original appearance, it should be considered an aberration; in the end, it will seek to spread misery and extinguish both light and life.</p><h1>Layers</h1><p>It’s always night in Mabar, and its shadowy moon, Sypheros, remains fixed in the sky. While the setting varies across its countless layers—a desert, a ruined city, the withered remains of fertile farmland - the story is always about loss, entropy, despair, and death. A layer might contain a massive battlefield filled with the intertwined bones of dragons and giants. Ossuaries and catacombs. Crumbling memorials, with names too faded to read. Barren orchards and dried riverbeds. And tombs, from tiny unmarked crypts to the death-palaces of fallen rulers, necropolises filled with traps and treasures. And this being the Endless Night, some of those dead rulers still dominate their domains, whether they take the form of undead or simply malevolent will.</p><p>Layers are linked in domains, and each one is bound to one of the Dark Powers. The denizens of the layers and the overall themes reflect the influence of that Dark Power, so layers in the Kingdom of Bones are largely inhabited by undead, while yugoloths dwell in layers bound to the Amaranthine City. Some layers are bounded by physical barriers, but most either loop back on themselves or end in walls of fog - not unlike the dead-gray mists of the Mournland - and any who wander into the mists reemerge elsewhere in the layer. Within domains, layers are often connected by physical portals - perhaps a massive gate or a pool of shadows. Moving between domains requires plane shift or performing a ritual tied to that domain. These rituals need not be magical; they’re simply secrets that have to be learned. If you’re in the Kingdom of Bones and you want to get to the domain of the Queen of All Tears, the answer is simple: All you have to do is sincerely cry, and your tears will take you there.</p><p>Here are three examples of Mabar’s domains, each of which could hold many layers.</p><h2>The Amaranthine City</h2><p>The Amaranthine City is widely seen as the heart of Mabar. Experienced planar travelers may find it familiar, for it’s a dark reflection of the Amaranthine City of Irian. Irian shows the city in its first days of glory: prosperous, clean, full of joy and life. The Amaranthine City of Mabar is a haunted shadow of this glory. Like its counterpart, this immense metropolis fills an entire layer, but here, its banners are faded and torn, walls are cracked, and fountains are dry. Shadows still move through the streets, a miserable reminder of the crowds that once filled the city. The rotting tapestries and chipped mosaics speak of a past age of wonders and glory. The two are unmistakably the same city, both in architectural style and the layout of its streets. This feels like the last days of a grand empire, an image of decaying grandeur; but there’s great power beneath the tragic façade. The walls may be cracked, but they are still mighty, and the mezzoloth’s rusty trident can kill you as easily as a polished one.</p><p>The city’s ruler, the Empress of Shadows, is the first and greatest of the Dark Powers. Her defining principle is hunger, the desire to consume all that is light, to expand her empire across eternity. She prefers an elegant fiendish form, with polished horns and chitin plates engraved with arcane sigils, but she can take the shape of any yugoloth. She spends much of her time presiding over the decaying pomp and grandeur of the Amaranthine City, but also closely monitors the campaigns in the Hinterlands and occasionally takes time to torment her hostages. The sages of Syrania believe that the Empress of Shadows chooses which fragments of other planes will be pulled into Mabar, and planar emissaries sometimes dwell in the Amaranthine City seeking to negotiate with her.</p><p>This city is the seat of the yugoloths; for every yugoloth in the Amaranthine City of Mabar, there is an angel in the city in Irian, all the way up to the Dawn Empress and the Empress of Shadows. Most likely, this is just a way of reflecting the planes’ core concepts - beginnings and endings, hope and despair. But it’s possible that Irian and Mabar are somehow the same - perhaps the Dawn Empress is the Empress of Shadows, and though they appear to exist at the same time, they reflect the beginning and end of the same spirit.</p><p>The layers tied to the Amaranthine City reflect its theme of imperial ambition and decaying power. Some embody desperation - a collapsing fortress awaiting an assault that will surely destroy it, or an abandoned sanitarium whose inmates are trapped and starving. These regions are inhabited by shadows, but the fiendish gardeners can instill near-sentience into them if it serves their purposes. Fragments claimed by the Empress of Shadows are drawn into her empire, and usually acquire a yugoloth outpost even as the life is drained from the region.</p><h2>The Kingdom of Bones</h2><p>Where the domain of the Amaranthine City feels like an empire in its last days, the Kingdom of Bones is one that’s already fallen. If a layer contains a fortress, it’s not preparing for a final battle; it’s what remained after the battle. The gates are shattered, and bloodstains and broken weapons are scattered across the floors. The people of this domain fought a dreadful war and lost... but this being Mabar, their bones remain. The skeletons of peasants continue their menial labors, seemingly oblivious to the futility of their actions. Even in death, these commoners are oppressed by their cruel lords. Wights, deathlocks, and vampire spawn might serve as the soldiers of the tyrants, while the overlords themselves may be vampires or mummy lords, still ruling from their ruined keeps.</p><p>All of the kingdom’s cursed nobles bow before the Bone King, who embodies the concepts of death and decay. A lich in rotting finery, he stands as a warning that even the mightiest lords eventually become dust and bone. He prefers to drain the life slowly from fragments he claims; he wants his hostages to dwell on their coming death while their land withers around them, for lords to turn on their people before he finally kills them all.</p><p>The Bone King’s statistics could be represented using Orcus as a foundation. He can serve as an Undying patron for warlocks, and is known to teach mortal wizards the foul rituals that allow ascension to lichdom. To all who serve him in this way, he grants titles in his kingdom - and the knowledge that when they die, they’ll be forever bound to serve in it. He makes few demands of these servants; they feed him whenever they use the powers he grants to slay the living. But a warlock may be tasked to destroy a lich or vampire - or even another warlock - because the Bone King desires them to serve in his kingdom.</p><h2>The Last Desert</h2><p>A desert of black sand under a starless sky - this is one of Mabar’s iconic images. In the Last Desert, there are remnants of glorious monuments: the half-buried head of a grand statue, its eye cracked; a fragment of a memorial wall, engraved with names that can no longer be read; ruins so worn that it’s impossible to guess what purpose the building once served. Characters proficient in History and Arcana can recognize that these monuments are drawn from dramatically different cultures; some are the work of celestials, while others might have been created by the giants of Xen’drik.</p><p>At the center lies a massive tomb-palace. Its style suggests the architecture of Aerenal, but it’s grander than even the City of the Dead. This is the fortress of the Queen of All Tears, the Dark Power of this domain. The Queen is an embodiment of misery, and her subjects are largely incorporeal undead, shadows and wraiths from the barren sand. Meanwhile, cruel specters and banshees attend the Queen, along with succubi and incubi who bask in the delicious misery that suffuses the region. The Queen herself takes the form of a mummified corpse, enshrouded by a spectral image of a beautiful elf woman. The suffering of others is her mead, and her only pleasure is the slow torment of the hostages in her Hinterland fragments.</p><p>The Queen of All Tears is one of the youngest of the Dark Powers. She was once a mortal who dreamed of mastering life and death, but her pursuit of these goals resulted in the deaths of everyone she ever loved and everyone who shared her blood. Her kingdom was razed, and she killed her own daughter and transformed her into a lich, so at least one piece of her legacy might survive. Her name was Minara Vol, and she was the mother of Erandis Vol. In the process of becoming a Dark Power, she’s lost much of her own identity and sense of her past. She despises both elves and dragons, but has forgotten even her own daughter. If the Queen were to somehow regain her memories, she might seek to strike at the Undying Court and Argonnessen, or to aid Erandis - or it may be that she continues to dwell in her despair and ignore her past.</p><p>The Queen’s layers are largely desolate and miserable, filled with wailing wraiths and banshees. One is a battlefield plucked from Aerenal, where the bones of elves and dragons lie intertwined; this may hold the key to discovering her past.</p><h2>The Hinterlands</h2><p>The Hinterlands are the outer edge of Mabar, the collection of planar fragments that are currently being consumed and integrated into the Endless Night. Here, the Hunger of Mabar property has not yet taken hold, which generally makes them safer to visit than other layers of Mabar. The Mabaran properties a fragment reflects vary depending on its nature and how close it is to complete integration with Mabar.</p><p>There can be infinite variety in the fragments within the Hinterlands. This largely depends on what plane a fragment is from. Is it a verdant forest of Lamannia? A floating tower of Syrania? Or is it a piece of the Material Plane—a fortress plucked out of the Last War or a Riedran village? The second question is how long the fragment has been under siege. To what degree does it retain its original flavor, and how much has the influence of Mabar overtaken it? The final question is which of the Dark Powers has claimed it - and why? What is it about this region that draws it toward a Dark Power’s domain? The Empress of Shadows looks for places that shine too brightly - places that bask in their achievements, sure their glory will never fade. The Bone King claims fragments where commoners suffer or where rulers turn to tyranny; there are a few Karrnathi fragments in his domain, though it can be hard to tell how close they are to being subsumed. The Queen of All Tears seeks the places where terrible tragedies have occurred, forcing the inhabitants to forever dwell in these moments of misery. With fragments of the outer planes, it’s more a question of reshaping the plane to fit these stories. By contrast, when it comes to the Material Plane, it’s the story itself that often draws the dire hand of Mabar</p><h1>Mabaran Stories</h1><p>Mabar inspires cruelty and despair. Its necrotic energies can be a general environmental threat or harnessed as a weapon by warlocks or necromancers. Here are some stories you might explore about this plane.</p><h2>Fragmented Mourning</h2><p>It’s unlikely that the Mourning was caused by Mabar. The effect is much larger than any fragment, the lingering strangeness doesn’t resemble Mabar, and people know it’s been destroyed, unlike with most fragments. However, it’s entirely possible that part of Cyre could have been claimed by Mabar as the Mourning unfolded—perhaps Metrol still exists in the Hinterlands of Mabar! If so, is there any chance it could be saved? Is Queen Dannel alive? Or could she have somehow been responsible, sacrificing her own people to become one of the Dark Powers herself?</p><h2>Shadow on the Moor</h2><p>While passing across a moor, the adventurers are set upon by the shadows of wolves and hawks. The following dawn, they discover that one of the characters is missing their shadow; it’s been lost in the manifest zone. Do they need to go back and find it? If so, how? If not, what does it mean that this character no longer has a shadow?</p><h2>The Master of Shadholt</h2><p>A cruel warlock holds a small village in his grip. When the adventurers defeat the villain, they make an unpleasant discovery: the village of Shadholt is in a Mabaran manifest zone, and while the warlock was a villain, his rituals also prevented the zone from spreading plagues throughout the entire region. Can the adventurers help one of the villagers take the warlock’s place, forging the pact and gaining the powers needed to contain the threat? What Dark Power must they deal with?</p><h2>The Drifting Citadel</h2><p>The adventurers are contacted by Itheriel, a scholar-angel of Syrania. The celestial seeks to recover a tome of knowledge from a library tower that was consumed by Mabar. If Itheriel goes to Mabar, they’ll be trapped there for eternity; they need the adventurers to recover the book. What isn’t Itheriel telling them about the book? Could this celestial relic have become the Book of Vile Darkness? What else can be found in the drifting tower?</p><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1300000,"name":"Risia: The Plain of Ice","type":"text","_id":"Jye04stTVoryE6OW","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><section class=\"traits\"><p>Cold</p><p>Timeless</p><p>Immeasurable</p></section><hr /><p><strong>Moon </strong>Dravago, the Herder<br /><strong>Moon and Portal Color</strong> Lavender<br /><strong>Native Inhabitants</strong> Spirits of Ice, Frost Giants and Dwarves</p><hr /><blockquote><p>Risia is known as the Plain of Ice, for that’s the vast majority of what’s found within it. Risia is defined by endless arctic wastes, and what appear to be mountains are just peaks of solid ice. But like Fernia, Risia’s appearance can be deceiving. Because it’s filled with glaciers and snow, many sages assume that this is its defining principle. But in Lamannia, there are also endless blizzards and majestic glaciers - ice in its natural state. By comparison, the core ideas that define Risia are isolation, stagnation, and preservation. The endless frozen plane isn’t about snow, it’s about the utter stillness, the empty and unchanging landscape. Risia is sparsely populated, because that’s the point of it; it’s bleak and lonely, a realm in which you could walk for days and never see another creature. Where a desert of sand can at least shift in the breeze, the frozen landscape of Risia is unchanging. Yet, unlike a stone plateau, it reflects a substance that could change at one point—but is now caught, frozen, stagnant.</p></blockquote><p>Though this isolated and unchanging plane might not seem appealing to adventurers, it’s important to remember that the plane represents preservation - and ancient secrets forgotten for ages could be frozen within the ice. And while the realm itself is barren, it’s not completely deserted; over millennia, hardy creatures have come to Risia and settled in this desolate realm.</p><h1>Manifest Zones</h1><p>Manifest zones to Risia are often found in cold or arctic regions, where their impact isn’t immediately obvious. In warmer climes, most manifest zones tied to Risia create regions of unnatural cold, often taking on the plane’s Lethal Cold and Empowered Ice properties of the plane, regardless of the regional climate.</p><p>In a few Risian zones, the effects of Stillness of Flesh can be felt, slowing or completely stopping the aging, growth, and reproduction of all creatures—except for dwarves, that is. While a manifest zone that prevents aging could be otherwise considered quite a boon, these zones can be quite small, and often tied to deadly cold that makes it difficult to live there.</p><p>It’s unusual for a Risian zone to transport people to Risia, but it can happen when the planes are coterminous. A Risia manifest zone typically manifests one or two of the planar effects. In addition, it may have the following additional properties.</p><h2>Continual Ice </h2><p>Bits of ice and snow that will not melt seem to persist throughout the region. These frozen bits do not melt even if they are removed from the region.</p><h2>Permafrost </h2><p>The area is dotted with ice and permafrost, from which mephits and elementals emerge with regularity. Bodies of water are unusually cool even if the surrounding region is hot.</p><h1>Coterminous and Remote</h1><p>While Risia is coterminous, temperatures drop sharply, and areas that would normally be chilly but otherwise safe can take on the Lethal Cold, Empowered Ice, and Stillness of Flesh universal properties. During these times, on rare occasions, creatures caught in an area of exceptionally intense cold can be unexpectedly transported to Risia. However, this effect is unpredictable; while it can happen if it serves the story, it’s not something most people are afraid of.</p><p>While Risia is remote, intense cold loses some of its bite. Regions of cold temperature become one stage higher than normal. In addition, creatures increase their resistance to cold damage by 5.</p><p>Traditionally, Risia becomes coterminous once every five years for the full month of Zarantyr. Once every five years, exactly two and a half years after it is coterminous, it’s remote during the month of Lharvion. However, this isn’t always the case. Historians have recorded times when the cycle has extended far longer; in 657 YK, Risia entered a coterminous phase that lasted for three years.</p><h1>Planar Effects</h1><p>Risia is bitterly cold, and unprotected creatures quickly succumb to the deadly temperatures. Here are a few of the consistent properties of the plane.</p><h2>Lethal Cold</h2><p>All regions of Fernia are subject to temperatures of extreme cold (Core Rulebook page 517), though some regions reach temperatures of incredible cold. All creatures increase their resistance to fire damage by 5.</p><h2>Empowered Ice</h2><p>Cold spells are enhanced, while fire spells are impeded (Gamemastery Guide page 136). When you Cast a Spell with the cold trait, that spell is automatically heightened 1 level, up to a level equal to the highest spell level you can cast.</p><h2>Preservation</h2><p>When a creature starts its turn with the dying condition, it loses the dying condition and remains unconscious at 0 hit points, increasing the wounded condition as normal. While unconscious at 0 hit points, you enter a state of suspended animation. If an unconscious creature at 0 hit points remains in contact with the ground for more than 1 minute, it’s drawn below the surface and encased in an ice-encrusted stasis. While encased in this way, time ceases to flow for the creature and it doesn’t grow older.</p><h2>Stagnation</h2><p>When a creature rests, it does not regain any hit points.</p><h2>Stillness of Flesh</h2><p>Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane and is consistent across its layers. However, the passage of time has no effect on a mortal creature’s body, and creatures don’t age or grow while in Risia. Exhaustion, starvation, and disease merely reduce a creature to 0 hit points and do not kill it. Dwarves are immune to this property’s effects, and in Risia they can grow, age, and die, just as they would on the Material Plane.</p><h1>Denizens</h1><p>Risia’s few natives are rarely seen. The concept of the plane is bleak isolation, and an active population would defeat this purpose. A few layers hold creatures that have crossed into Risia from Eberron, ones that can thrive in arctic conditions; there are remorhazes hunting in the Frozen Sea and yetis in the Frostmantle. But these things come and go. The two primary forces in Risia are the native spirits of the plane and the frost giants that have carved out a home in the ice.</p><h2>Spirits of Ice</h2><p>At first glance, Risia appears to be barren and empty. But some travelers have described a presence, a sense of being watched, and most feel this presence is malign. On the surface, the concept of Risia seems entirely neutral; there’s nothing inherently evil about ice. But there’s a hunger to Risia—an innate desire to consume warmth and to bury living things in ice. In the Planar Codex, Dorius Alyre ir’Korran calls this force the Killing Cold. This greatest power of the plane of isolation is uninterested in being known, and has never interacted directly with outsiders, but its presence can be felt through its manifestations. These include bheur hags, frost salamanders, ice devils, chain devils, and the Lonely (sorrowsworn). The appearance and nature of manifestations reflect the themes of Risia - a chain devil might be shrouded by frost-mist and can bind its enemies with chains of ice. Regardless of their form, these spirits don’t speak with outsiders. Their intelligence reflects the cunning with which they stalk their prey, but they are spirits of the Killing Cold, of bitter isolation, and of the ice that entombs and preserves.</p><p>When these manifestations aren’t active, they’re absorbed into their layer; they manifest when they’re needed, in the form that’s needed. And in the meantime, as spirits of stagnation and isolation, they’re perfectly content to sit in silence for centuries before something compels them back into physical form.</p><h2>Frost Giants and Dwarves</h2><p>The Group of Eleven was an alliance of empyreans of tremendous skill and power. Each studied a different plane (leaving Fernia to the Sulat League and Dal Quor to the Cul’sir). The archarcanist Il’Ara was devoted to Risia, and she magebred her own lineage of frost giants over millennia. When the forces of Argonnessen began to lay waste to Xen’drik, Il’Ara gathered her faithful children and passed through to Risia, certain that they could find sanctuary in the isolation of the Plain of Ice.</p><p>Il’Ara’s children have since established themselves across the layers of Risia. There are a few citadels where multiple giants live together, while others have established their own solitary outposts. Each has found a different path to surviving the endless tedium of immortality in the icy wastes. Some have become artists, writing poetry or sculpting massive works of art that take centuries to complete. Others pursue physical diversions such as wrestling, hunting fiends, or crafting ornate games. These denizens always take great interest in outsiders as a source of diversion. The crueler giants take joy in hunting newcomers, but others can be excellent hosts. Many artists yearn for an audience - though a genteel giant artist can be deadly if guests don’t show proper appreciation for their work. As these Risian frost giants are remnants of the grand civilization of Xen’drik, the DM may wish to increase their intelligence and abilities as suits the story.</p><p>Il’Ara continues her arcane studies in her fortress, Winter. She may have found ways to wield vast power over Risia and to protect her children from the fiends... or she could be bored of her immortal existence, considering entering the ice and embracing stasis.</p><p>The frost giants of Risia have dwarf servants. Their origin is a mystery: the giants know that Il’Ara produced these first dwarves, but they don’t know - or at least remember - if she created them herself or pulled them through from Eberron. These dwarves know no other existence than their servitude to their giant masters, and Risia holds few other options for them. Mysteriously, these dwarves - and all dwarves - are immune to the Stillness of Flesh property of Risia. They age just as they would on Eberron, and unlike other mortals on this plane, they can give birth to children who grow and mature. So every giant in Risia came from Xen’drik, and as they die, no new giants replace them; but the dwarves that dwell in Risia were born there, and know nothing of the ancient past.</p><h1>Layers</h1><p>The layers of Risia are few in number but vast in size, connected by great archways of ice. Sometimes, travelers find pools of ice that show images from other layers; breaking through this ice sometimes allows passage, while other times, the images are simply lost. While depictions of Risia often show it with terrifying storms, these are only found in the Boundless Blizzard; most of Risia is utterly still, silent, and deadly. Risia’s spirit manifestations can be found in all of these layers. The giants are concentrated in Frostmantle, but outliers can be found in other layers.</p><p>The most noteworthy layers are discussed below, but others exist as well. One is a vast, featureless glacier, which may be the inspiration for the title “The Plain of Ice.” A small layer holds immense ice sculptures of unknown humanoids; this could be a reflection of primal beings, or perhaps the work of a frost giant artisan who’s been sculpting for thousands of years. Another plane contains a series of rivers flowing over an icy plain, but they aren’t natural water; the liquid is so cold it shatters any mundane material placed within it.</p><h2>Frostmantle</h2><p>This seemingly endless range of mountains, formed of solid ice, is surrounded by a sea of dense mist. Perhaps land lies somewhere far below, or the mountains might continue down indefinitely into the darkness. Frostmantle is the primary home of the frost giants of Il’Ara, who have carved citadels from the ice of the mountains. The three largest fortresses are called Freehearth, Remorse, and Winter. Remorse holds many giants who have chosen to enter icy stasis out of eternal boredom, while Winter is the abode of Il’Ara herself. Numerous smaller keeps are spread across the peaks, the abodes of individual giants.</p><p>Clouds hide the sky above Frostmantle, but the light is steady and unchanging; night never falls here. Travelers must deal with the effects of high altitude as well as the lethal cold.</p><h2>The Boundless Blizzard</h2><p>Chill winds howl as snow and hail fill the air. Explorers may find themselves on an icy plateau or in a mountain pass; with the vicious storm, visibility is limited to 60 feet, so there’s no knowing what lies ahead. Adventurers may find an occasional cave or other shelter, but it’s always possible that it’s already occupied by a remorhaz or other stranded monstrosity. As this is one of the more dangerous layers, this is a good place to search for the frozen bodies of other adventurers, held in stasis beneath the ice.</p><p>The raging storm of the Boundless Blizzard never ends, and adventurers face high winds and lethal cold. The layer is permanently caught between night and day; due to the storm, the light is dim at best, and areas of intense snow may be heavily obscured.</p><h2>The Frozen Sea</h2><p>Imagine an ocean frozen in a single instant. There’s no sign of any shore, just waves caught mid-crest alongside the frozen funnels of maelstroms. And scattered across the realm, there are countless ships—vessels pulled from the oceans of Eberron in moments when the moons were right and Risia was coterminous. Some are shattered or wrecked, caught halfway through the process of sinking. Others are in perfect condition, frozen under the thinnest layer of ice. Ships from throughout history can be found here, Lyrandar elemental galleons alongside massive ships built by the ancient giants of Xen’drik. There could be age-old survivors here, sheltering in their trapped vessels, or a frost giant might have raised a tower of ice above the frozen water. But the spirits are strong here as well, preying on survivors and pulling them down into the frozen depths.</p><p>It’s always night on the Frozen Sea; the moon Dravago is fixed in the cloudless sky, shedding dim light on the water</p><h1>Risian Stories</h1><p>Risia is barren, isolated, and unwelcoming; it’s not a place that wants adventurers. Nonetheless, there are many ways it could affect a story.</p><h2>Frozen History </h2><p>Il’Ara and her giants possess wondrous relics whose like haven’t been seen in Eberron since the Age of Giants. They’re a living link to the elven uprising; a giant might have personally fought a Tairnadal elf’s ancestor, and it could possess a trophy taken from them. If the adventurers need information or an object from the Age of Giants, they might find it here. The adventurers could seek a ritual found only in Il’Ara’s colossal spellbook, or perhaps the empyrean has kept a collection of prisoners from the Age of Giants preserved in Risian ice; this could be a way to meet a Qabalrin elf or one of the first drow! </p><h2>Buried Treasures </h2><p>In searching for a vital artifact, the adventurers might learn it’s on a ship trapped in the Frozen Sea. The trail of a lost explorer could lead to the Boundless Blizzard. While adventurers could recover valuable treasures from the ice, it’s also possible to recover people from it. A legendary hero—or infamous villain—could have been trapped in Risia for centuries. What would happen if adventurers discovered the pirate queen Lhazaar in an icy stasis on her ship in the Frozen Sea?</p><h2>Dwarves</h2><p>What’s the origin of the dwarves of Risia? Did the empyrean Il’Ara truly create the dwarves, or did she steal them from the Frostfell? Could dwarf adventurers free their distant cousins from the domination of the giants?</p><h2>The Killing Cold </h2><p>What is the sinister presence that drives the spirits of ice? No mortal has ever interacted directly with the Killing Cold. When the adventurers are caught in the Boundless Blizzard, they are stalked by deadly manifestations of the Cold. Can they find some way to communicate with these spirits—or the power that drives them?</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1400000,"name":"Shavarath: The Eternal Battleground","type":"text","_id":"X00GlMLMIN6TYRep","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><section class=\"traits\"><p>Flowing</p><p>Immeasurable</p></section><hr /><p><strong>Moon </strong>Vult, the Warder<br /><strong>Moon and Portal Color</strong> Pockmarked steel-gray<br /><strong>Native Inhabitants</strong> Conscripts, Sword Wraiths, Whirling Blades, Angels, Demons, Devils</p><hr /><blockquote><p>In Shavarath, angels and devils are locked in endless conflict. Radiant blades spill burning blood, and bolts of force smash angels from the sky. In another layer, champions of justice ride armored dragons, assaulting a titanic airship. In yet another, steel krakens tear apart celestial frigates. There’s only one constant in Shavarath: war.</p></blockquote><p>The war in Shavarath began at the moment of creation, and it will continue to the end of time. Its primary combatants are immortal, and fallen soldiers return within a day or so. The forces are so evenly matched that a decisive victory is impossible. To outsiders, this war seems pointless. Over the last four hundred years of conflict in Nullius Terram, the Legion of Justice has advanced its front line by perhaps 20 feet. Mortals may look at this and ask, “Why continue to fight? Why not just leave the struggle and do something - anything - else?” In particular, it’s common for mortals to see the vast resources the celestials devote to the war and protest, “Why don’t you help us? You claim to be the Legion of Justice, but innocent people are dying in Thaliost while you fight this meaningless war!”</p><p>The angel isn’t fighting for a single nation, and this war isn’t driven by gold or politics. The immortals of Shavarath believe that their war is reflected across every reality. Justice. Tyranny. Cruelty. The war in Shavarath is a visible symbol of the balance of power between these forces, and when it shifts in Shavarath, the immortals believe it shifts everywhere. Fallen devils will be reborn. New airships will replace those destroyed. But every tiny victory - every demon defeated, every foot advanced in Nullius Terram - strengthens the forces of justice everywhere. Each angel knows they will never win a truly decisive victory, but as long as they fight, they can at least hold the line.</p><p>So to an angel, the destruction of a human city - or an entire nation - is trivial. Mortals will die; that’s their most defining trait. Even a sympathetic angel sees a mortal as a snowflake: unique, beautiful, but gone in a moment (and sooner if you touch it). The angels fought long before today’s mortal civilizations existed, and if they hadn’t held this line for countless eons, the Material Plane would be overrun by chaos and cruelty.</p><p>If you’re a hero, you might look to the angel and say, “What can I do to help? Can we fight at your side?” To which the angel simply smiles and responds, “You already are.” Just as every mortal dreams in Dal Quor and has a shadow in Mabar, there’s a sliver of every mortal soul that fights in Shavarath. The skill and power of these conscripts reflect your own courage and will... and just like the angels, this sliver of yours can survive a thousand deaths. So it’s not your place to fight on the battlefields of Shavarath. You do your part by living your life, by fighting for the principles you believe in wherever you may be.</p><p>There is war in Shavarath, and there will always be war in Shavarath. It can’t be won, and it can’t be abandoned. As a mortal in Shavarath, your primary goal should always be to survive - because in Shavarath, there are a million ways to die.</p><h1>Manifest Zones</h1><p>Manifest zones tied to Shavarath often inspire people to violence and aggression, and can convey any of the plane’s universal properties. These zones can be dangerous places to dwell, but can also encourage martial discipline and enhance training. While many of the greatest weapons in Shavarath can’t be removed from the plane, manifest zones tied to Shavarath can often provide inspiration for artificers and smiths, and it may be possible to craft deadly enchantments in a Shavaran manifest zone that simply aren’t possible beyond it.</p><p>Manifest zones rarely act as gateways to Shavarath, but anything is possible when Shavarath is coterminous.</p><h1>Coterminous and Remote</h1><p>When Shavarath is coterminous, people are quick to anger and must be careful to not fight over trivial things. Angry words are more likely to produce brawls, and restless thought to lead to riots or revolutions. The plane’s War Magic and Unquenchable Fury properties spread worldwide while it’s coterminous, encouraging violence. Meanwhile, in Shavaran manifest zones, outbreaks of intense violence can draw whirling blades into the zone, slaughtering people on all sides.</p><p>Shavarath is traditionally coterminous for 1 year every 36 years. Throughout history, some military leaders have plotted campaigns around this, while peaceful communities plan ahead to contain violence. In addition to its regular cycle, Shavarath frequently grows coterminous for a single day; predicting these periods was critical for battle strategy during the Last War. Shavarath is traditionally remote for a year every 36 years, which prevents the occasional single-day coterminous spikes, but otherwise has no apparent effect on the Material Plane.</p><h1>Planar Effects</h1><p>There’s a part of you that’s always been in Shavarath, a sliver of your soul that’s always been at war. When you’re in Shavarath, those instincts guide you. It’s easier to strike a deadly blow, or to grit your teeth and fight on through pain or injury.</p><h2>War Magic</h2><p>When a creature casts a spell that grants a bonus to AC, attack rolls, or saving throws or a spell that grants temporary hit points, its range is doubled; if that spell has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is also doubled.</p><h2>Unquenchable Fury</h2><p>Creatures gain a +2 status bonus to saving throws against any spells or abilities that improve a target's Attitude or soothe their emotions such as Calm Emotions. In addition, the duration of these effects is halved, to a minimum duration of 1 round. In addition, a barbarian's rage cannot be ended early unless they are knocked unconscious.</p><h2>Fight On</h2><p>On a creature’s turn, it can use an action to spend a Hero Point to regain 1d10 + level + Constitution modifier hit points (minimum of 1).</p><h2>Bloodletting</h2><p>All creatures gain the critical specialization of their weapons. If a creature already had access to the critical specialization, they apply its effects on successful hits as well.</p><h2>Flexible Time</h2><p>Time’s passage varies between Shavarath’s layers. In many, time passes at the same rate as on the Material Plane, but other layers move at different speeds.</p><h1>Denizens</h1><p>All creatures in Shavarath are part of the war, whether they’re soldiers, tools, or victims. Those that fight are tied to legions, such as the Legion of Justice or the Legion of Tyranny. The immortals that fight in the war believe that each legion is governed by a higher power—simply called Command—and that these powers collectively shape the layers and determine the terms of battle. Immortals don’t question Command or wonder why things are the way they are. Immortals never deal directly with the Command of their legion, and they don’t even know if these powers have physical forms.</p><p>Vast legions are broken into smaller cohorts, which are in turn divided into centuries of one hundred immortals, each representing an aspect of war like pain, mercy, or despair. A few special centuries and individual immortals can move between layers, but the majority are bound to their cohort and their layer. Immortals can be reassigned to new cohorts, and promoted or demoted - usually tied to a physical transformation. This minimal movement between layers maintains balance, as cohort leaders must make use of the forces in their layer, while legion commanders can strategically direct the centuries that can move between layers - what layer is Justice pressing at the moment?</p><p>An offensive’s primary goals often focus on destroying an important opponent. The Legion of Justice knows it can’t drive Tyranny from Nullius Terram, but defeating Lord Commander Astaralax is an important victory for the light, even though he’s an immortal and will eventually return. Sometimes an especially grand victory might cause an immortal to be “discharged - when this happens, a new being of equivalent power takes its place, but it has a new personality, and the original spirit is eradicated. Such victories are worth even more points in the grand system that calculates the balance of power between the legions.</p><h2>Conscripts</h2><p>In Nullius Terram, the trenches are filled with miserable soldiers waiting for the offensive. The City of Knives is filled with innocents struggling to survive and looters taking advantage of the chaos. There are dragons in the Burning Sky - but none of these are mortals. They’re all manifestations, ideas conscripted to serve the purpose of the story. Conscripts appear to be sentient, but have no depth of personality or memory, can’t leave their layers, and can’t accomplish anything meaningful unless accompanied by a celestial or fiend. It’s only when the angel leads a charge that the conscripts of Nullius Terram matter, and though they inevitably die, they eventually reform. Conscripts can use the statistics of the creatures they appear to be, but may not have their full capabilities; the dragons of the Burning Sky aren’t as intelligent as true dragons. A conscript usually appears indistinct; it’s hard to focus on them, and it’s often easy for a viewer to imagine conscripts are members of their own species.</p><h2>Sword Wraiths</h2><p>All mortal creatures have a spiritual connection to Shavarath, and there’s a sliver of their spirit in the plane. The strength of this sliver is determined by the mortal’s courage, willpower, and martial drive. Conscripts are formed from this spiritual energy, but have no awareness and may be formed from multiple slivers; unlike Irian’s embers, the conscript doesn’t resemble the source.</p><p>Sometimes, on the death of a great mortal warrior, echoes of their personality and martial spirit can coalesce into a sword wraith (though its abilities may vary based on the champion it echoes). Unlike standard conscripts, sword wraiths are capable of meaningful action even without the direction of an immortal and can command conscripts of their own. A sword wraith has the appearance of its mortal source and some of the memories, but it’s only an echo of the mortal, much like the traces of memory that allow you to speak with dead. Sword wraiths reconcile their memories with the war within the layer. If there’s a sword wraith of Karrn the Conqueror commanding troops in Nullius Terram, he believes that he’s fighting for Karrnath and can’t be convinced otherwise; after all, he’s only a memory, and there are limits to his ability to reason.</p><p>So adventurers might meet Lhazaar as she commands a ship in the Bloody Sea. Dhakaani champions, the Mror clan founders, heroes of the Last War—any of these could be found as sword wraiths, serving the legion that best matches their values. There are sword wraiths of many patron ancestors of the Tairnadal elves; however, these aren’t the patrons themselves, simply echoes left behind. While sword wraiths generally form after a mortal’s death, the slivers of especially remarkable heroes can manifest sword wraiths even while alive. King Boranel of Breland surely has a sword wraith serving in the Legion of Justice, and it’s possible an adventurer could meet their own sword wraith while exploring Shavarath</p><h2>Whirling Blades</h2><p>Shavarath’s whirling blades are enigmatic and deadly. These manifestations are swarms of animated weapons—knives, swords—that tear through the air, eviscerating anything unfortunate enough to be in their path. Sometimes they follow consistent paths like flocks of birds. Other times, they appear in a flash, lashing at victims, then vanishing. The whirling blades may be a defense mechanism designed to keep mortals from interfering with Shavarath, and the longer mortals remain in Shavarath, the more likely they are to be struck. These blade storms can also leak out into the Material Plane in areas of particularly brutal conflict, spilling blood on all sides.</p><p>Whirling blades might take the form of a cloud of daggers, though the area and damage might both increase, or the most devastating manifestations could be represented with a blade barrier that slowly moves across the terrain.</p><h2>Angels</h2><p>Most of Shavarath’s celestials serve the Legion of Justice, which embodies the concept of war fought for a just cause. Cohorts and their component centuries represent specific concepts within that broad ideal. The Century of Mercy shows kindness to fallen foes, while the Century of the Innocent Guard protects civilians - even if they’re just conscripts, the idea of civilians - and avoids collateral damage. Angels won’t conscript adventurers, but also won’t leave their duties to help them.</p><p>The angels of Shavarath have a martial aspect, most appearing clad in armor, with their faces - and species - hidden behind full helms. Any sort of angel can be found in Shavarath, with its power reflecting its position. Planetars command centuries, while each cohort is commanded by a solar or a celestial being of greater power, such as an empyrean. While the angels serve Justice Command, there are a few units also devoted to the Sovereigns. The Century of the Sun asserts that Dol Arrah is Justice Command, and sword wraiths formed from paladins of Dol Arrah serve with this century.</p><p>While the Legion of Justice is the largest of the celestial legions, there are others that operate on a smaller scale. Most notable of these is the Legion of Freedom, reflecting the ideal of war fought to end oppression. They rarely field large armies and instead use swift strikes and guerrilla war; these angels embody the idea of champions who fight impossible odds for a noble cause, even if this forces them to follow ignoble paths.</p><h2>Demons</h2><p>Demons represent the chaotic savagery of war. Most serve the Legion of Cruelty, and are wild, brutal, and far less disciplined than the devilish forces of Tyranny. They torture civilians, have no concern for collateral damage or their own losses, and make little effort to hold territory. Their focus is purely on inflicting maximum damage on foes and their own region alike. The Century of the Salted Earth devastates the regions they fight in, while the Century of Terror creates hideous displays with the corpses of their victims and delights in psychological warfare. The Legion of Cruelty slaughters devils and angels with equal glee, and is despised by Justice and Tyranny alike.</p><p>All manner of demons can be found in the Legion of Cruelty; their form reflects their military role, and many wear battered armor, steel scales, or are simply coated in fresh blood. Barlguras and hezrous are brutal shock troops. Chasmes and vrocks flood the skies, while goristros are living siege weapons. Mariliths and balors command centuries, while cohorts may be led by beings with the power of demon princes. As with all immortals of Shavarath, it’s important to remember that these demons are first and foremost embodiments of war; regardless of what role a demon might play on another plane, here, it’s devoted purely to the eternal war. It could be that there is a Cohort of Bones that uses undead conscripts in battle, commanded by a fiend with the stat block of Orcus - but this commander wouldn’t have Orcus’s ambitions, instead focusing on crushing the Cohort of the Sun in its layer.</p><p>As with angels devoted to the Sovereigns, some demons dedicate themselves and their unit to the Dark Six. Many within the Century of Terror wear the flayed skins of their foes and assert that the Mockery is part of Cruelty Command.</p><h2>Devils</h2><p>Devils can be just as cruel as demons, but they represent the disciplined practice of war in pursuit of oppression, and most serve the Legion of Tyranny. They seek to crush hope, and no form of treachery or dishonorable conduct is too low for a devil. However, they’re far more disciplined than the savage hordes of the Legion of Cruelty, working with precision and careful plans. The Century of Chains forces enemy conscripts (and unlucky adventurers) to fight for them, and uses civilian conscripts as living shields. The Century of the Serpent is always willing to negotiate and makes many pleasing offers, but any agreement inevitably leads to betrayal.</p><p>All forms of devils can be found in the Legion of Tyranny. Their sole focus is war; they dominate and corrupt conscripts, but don’t seek mortal souls from the Material Plane. Bearded and spined devils serve as basic troops, while elite squads of erinyes descend from the sky. Amnizu and balors command centuries, and beings with the power of archdevils lead cohorts.</p><p>The devils of the Cohort of Misery say that the Mockery is part of Tyranny Command, a belief that fuels a bitter enmity with the demons of the Century of Terror. Curiously, the Cohort of the Iron Hand maintains that the Sovereign Aureon leads Tyranny Command, and that they are simply enacting his vision for universal order</p><h2>Weapons of War</h2><p>The battlefields of Shavarath contain engines of war unlike anything imagined on Eberron. Steel krakens in the Bloody Sea. Massive cannons that could bring down Sharn’s towers with a single volley. Immense monstrosities that serve as living battering rams. However, even the grandest of these creations isn’t a product of industry or arcane science—these too are conscripts. The mighty cannon isn’t forged in some great foundry, but formed by the layer itself, because it’s part of the idea of this battle. Fernia is a plane of industry where an artificer might learn amazing techniques from the dao; by contrast, in Shavarath, an artificer might be inspired by what they see, but most of the greatest weapons can’t be replicated.</p><h1>Layers</h1><p>Shavarath has countless layers, each one reflecting a different struggle. There’s a vicious guerilla war in the Forest of Shadows. The Monolith is a mighty fortress that’s always under siege; occasionally, the attackers tear it away from the defenders, at which point the former defenders begin the siege anew. Layers are connected by a network of heavily fortified portals, though the most powerful immortals can shift between layers under their own power. Every legion has a command center or headquarters in the layers in which they operate. The legion might only assign a few centuries to smaller layers, but if a layer’s large enough - such as Nullius Terram - it may host an entire cohort.</p><p>These are a few examples of layers of Shavarath, but almost any vision of war could spawn a layer.</p><h2>Nullius Terram</h2><p>One of the largest layers, Nullius Terram is a battlefield the size of a small nation. It’s divided by several deep, heavily fortified trenches, which are separated by blasted regions of scorched earth, blast craters, and bones. Nullius Terram’s multiple trench lines twist and curve throughout the region, and in the lands between the trenches lie strategic outposts. The region is marked by constant barrages and terrible tools of mass destruction - widescale cloudkill, curses that transform conscripts into killers, and worse.</p><p>Tyranny, Cruelty, and Justice are the three active legions in this region. Justice has a difficult position in Nullius Terram, but has been slowly gaining strength. Periodically, the commanders send troops to clash in the fields between the lines, either in simple skirmishes or full offensives. Ultimately, the theme of this layer is that of slow, agonizing stalemate, and the suffering war can inflict on both the land and the soldiers.</p><p>Nullius Terram is noteworthy for its flowing time; for every 10 minutes that pass in this layer, only 1 minute passes in Eberron. So it’s a long, slow struggle—you could spend months here and only miss a week in Eberron.</p><h2>The Burning Sky</h2><p>The sky is filled with many airships, some large enough to be floating towns. A few islands of rock float amongst the solid clouds, but if there’s any land below, it’s hidden by deadly fog. While there are skirmishes on the stone islands, most of the action occurs in the skies. Winged angels and fiends circle and duel, while conscripts guide dragons and other aerial mounts.</p><h2>The City of Knives</h2><p>It looks like this was once a city of marvels, with towers rivaling those of Sharn, gilded monuments, museums, gardens, and more. But the City of Knives lies between vast armies of the Legion of Justice and the Legion of Tyranny, and it represents the impact of brutal war on a glorious city. Ongoing bombardment is a constant threat. The civilian conscripts are fighting their own war for shelter and supplies; some rally together for the common good, while others have become looters and brigands. Justice and Tyranny hold their positions on either side of the city, relying on bombardment and occasional assaults. The Legion of Cruelty spreads terror within the city, while the celestials of the Legion of Freedom seek to rally the common people against all enemies.</p><h2>The Bloody Sea</h2><p>There are no continents in this aquatic layer, but a handful of islands support the warring fleets. Grand and powerful warships clash in the open waters and bombard settlements. The ships may be familiar, but there are many other unusual engines of war: constructed krakens, submersible warships, monstrosities and dragons bound to service—wonders that the people of Eberron can imagine but can’t yet create. The pirate queen Lhazaar surely has inspired a sword wraith in the Bloody Sea... but which legion does her sword wraith fight for?</p><h2>The Warring Cities</h2><p>At first glance, this layer looks like the blasted land between the trenches of Nullius Terram. It’s home to a number of warring cities, but they aren’t static settlements. Rather, some are floating fortresses that dwarf the Argonth of Breland, and others walk on two legs. The warforged colossus in Eberron: Rising from the Last War could be used as a model for a small fortress.</p><h1>Shavaran Stories</h1><p>The simplest story is one of survival, escaping from Shavarath before being destroyed by the endless war. But Shavaran adventures touch the Material Plane too; here are some ideas.</p><h2>Blades of War</h2><p>Cannith builds a forgehold for manufacturing weapons on a manifest zone tied to Shavarath. All goes well— until a planar spike unleashes whirling blades and everything is thrown into chaos. Making things worse, some experimental constructs have gone berserk, an experimental Shavaran explosive is detonating in five hours . . . and it’s possible an agent of the Lord of Blades has infiltrated the hold in the chaos. Can the adventurers get things under control?</p><h2>The Surge </h2><p>In Fairhaven, an artificer creates an eldritch machine to channel Shavarath’s power—but it works too well. When Shavarath becomes coterminous, the eldritch machine amplifies everyone’s aggression. Riots and looting break out across the city, while the guards act brutally to contain it. Can the adventurers find and deactivate the machine before the city tears itself apart? Is this the work of a single reckless artificer, or tied to the cult of Rak Tulkhesh or the Order of the Emerald Claw?</p><h2>Deadly Weapon</h2><p>The adventurers find a corpse clutching a vorpal sword—the blade of Misery, an erinyes of the Legion of Tyranny. An agent of the Argentum died while attempting to take the blade to a place it could be destroyed. Will the adventurers try to complete the mission, or claim the powerful sword as a trophy? If they choose to keep it, Misery will eventually come looking for her sword . . . and this cruel immortal will want to take some time to torment any mortals who have sullied her blade.</p><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1500000,"name":"Syrania: The Azure Sky","type":"text","_id":"D2prDH5pPlE25HpN","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><section class=\"traits\"><p>Air</p><p>Immeasurable</p></section><p><strong>Moon </strong>Therendor, the Healer<br /><strong>Moon and Portal Color</strong> Blue-gray<br /><strong>Native Inhabitants</strong> Angels, Virtues, Dominions, Thrones</p><hr /><blockquote><p>Imagine a perfect blue sky, stretching off into the horizon. There’s no sign of the sun, but the sky is clear and bright, and the floating crystal towers gleam as if caught in a sunbeam. A warm, gentle breeze brushes over you, and there’s a faint sound of distant chimes. You feel absolutely calm; in this moment, all anger melts away.</p></blockquote><p>This is Syrania, the Azure Sky. While people often think of its floating towers and crystal spires—the same magic that sustains the great towers of Sharn— Syrania is the plane of peace and all that flourishes in peaceful times: commerce, education, reflection. There are no vast armies here, no dangerous monsters. The magic of Syrania allows all creatures to communicate and dispels aggression. As such, it’s a common crossroads for beings who do travel the planes, and the Immeasurable Market of Syrania is the safest place to interact with fiends, slaadi, and other extraplanar beings. However, while bloodshed is rare in the Azure Sky, you can still make deadly enemies; mortals are always wise to tread lightly in the cities of angels.</p><h1>Manifest Zones</h1><p>Manifest zones tied to Syrania can reflect one or more of the properties of the plane, but often in more limited ways. The manifest zone containing the city of Sharn has a lesser aspect of the Unburdened property; it doesn’t grant flight, but it enhances effects that grant flight or levitation, enabling the skycoaches and flying buttresses that support the towers. A zone that has the Absolute Peace property might have a lower DC for the saving throw, or it might encourage peaceful behavior without actively enforcing it. Temples are often built on Syranian zones with the Absolute Peace property, while universities and House Sivis search for zones with the Universal Understanding property.</p><p>In addition to standard manifest zones, there are a few portals to the Immeasurable Market hidden in Eberron. These take many forms; a back door could be an actual door, a large chest, or a shallow pool of water. A back door only opens under specific circumstances: when opened with a special key, when used at a certain time, when blood is spilled, or when a heart is broken. Most who discover these portals jealously guard them; a merchant with access to the Immeasurable Market can acquire remarkable goods!</p><h1>Coterminous and Remote</h1><p>When Syrania is coterminous, goodwill spreads across the world and people find it nearly impossible to contemplate violence. These periods brought welcome moments of peace during the Last War, and there are stories of enemy soldiers coming together to share stories or play games. During these times, the Absolute Peace and Gentle Thoughts properties apply across Eberron. However, if a creature is attacked, harmed by a spell, or witnesses its friends being harmed, that creature is unaffected by Absolute Peace for one minute. The influence of Syrania limits violence, but once conflicts break out, it can’t stop them.</p><p>While Syrania is coterminous, the skies are clear and the weather is calm—it’s believed that if you’re in a Syranian manifest zone during this time, it’s possible to fly into the Open Sky simply by flying straight up to the edge of the sky. This may be apocryphal or only true in certain manifest zones... there’s only one way to find out!</p><p>When Syrania is remote, the skies are gray and the sun can’t be seen. People feel quarrelsome and it’s difficult to come to an understanding. Creatures gain a +2 status bonus to intimidation checks, and a -2 status penalty to diplomacy checks. Outside of Syranian manifest zones, all flying speeds are reduced by 10 feet, to a minimum of 5 feet.</p><p>Traditionally, Syrania is coterminous on the 9th day of the month of Rhaan, once every ten years. Followers of the Sovereign Host celebrate this day every year as Boldrei’s Feast, a time for people to come together and resolve their grievances; the tenth-year coterminous celebrations are especially grand. Syrania is remote once every ten years on the same day, five years after the coterminous period. This day is still celebrated, as people make a conscious effort not to give into anger.</p><h1>Planar Effects</h1><p>Syrania encourages communication and negotiation, and grants all creatures the gift of flight. The Open Sky of Syrania is an endless void, and without flight, you could fall indefinitely; fortunately, all creatures find that they can move through the air just as naturally as walking.</p><h2>Unburdened</h2><p>Creatures gain a flying speed equal to their walking speed unless it already has a flying speed greater than or equal to their walking speed, in which case that speed increases by 10 feet.</p><h2>Gentle Thoughts</h2><p>Creatures gain a +2 status bonus to diplomacy checks, and a -2 status penalty to intimidation checks.</p><h2>Universal Understanding</h2><p>A creature can understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that it hears and can understand any written language that it can see. This doesn’t decode secret messages or reveal the meaning of symbols that aren’t part of a written language.</p><h2>Absolute Peace</h2><p>To make an attack or cast a damaging spell, a creature must succeed on a flat check of DC 5 + spell level. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the actions are still consumed.</p><h2>Standard Time</h2><p>Time passes at the same pace as on the Material Plane and is consistent across its layers.</p><h1>Denizens</h1><p>Syrania is a curiously empty plane. While the Immeasurable Market is always bustling, most of this traffic is comprised of creatures from other planes. Syrania’s other spires have comparatively few inhabitants—not so few that they feel desolate or barren, just enough so that it always feels slow and peaceful. There’s no need for people to perform menial tasks in Syrania, nor does this plane have manifestations to populate it; damaged structures gradually repair themselves, and litter and debris slowly dissolve.</p><p>The native inhabitants of Syrania are winged humanoid immortals, collectively referred to as angels, though they differ from those of other planes in some important ways. While they’re considered to be celestials, most angels of Syrania are neutral in alignment. They aren’t champions of justice or bringers of hope; rather, they’re observers and scholars, defined by their domain of study. The lesser immortals are simply referred to as angels, while the higher orders have titles—virtues, dominions, and thrones. These higher angels are bound to the contemplation of a particular concept, based on their domain, and devote their existence to contemplating and understanding it. Some believe that it’s through this contemplation that the concept continues to exist (though most inhabitants of other places—mortal and immortal alike—consider this to be highly unlikely). The appearance of Syranian angels is influenced by their domain, so the Dominion of Storms might be wreathed in lightning and have wings formed of storm clouds, while the Dominion of Trees could have bark for skin and moss for hair.</p><p>Unlike lesser angels and visitors to Syrania, virtues, dominions, and thrones are immune to the effects of Syrania’s Absolute Peace property, and are capable of taking aggressive action to defend Syrania, or when pursuing their domain—so a virtue of war could fight. However, they always try to find nonviolent or nonlethal solutions to threats.</p><h2>Angels</h2><p>Angels are the least of the immortals of Syrania. They have no names or domains and are generally interchangeable; they serve as scribes and guides, performing minor tasks. They do not engage in combat and their statistics are largely inconsequential.</p><h2>Virtues</h2><p>Virtues are a higher order of angel, with names and broad domains—Hazari, Virtue of Nature. They act as assistants and emissaries of the dominions. Virtues spend much of their time contemplating their domain, but they also gather information for their dominions—either by fetching existing records within Syrania, talking with creatures who visit the plane, or by venturing beyond Syrania and discretely observing. A dominion is always aware of everything that happens to its virtues and immediately knows all information they collect. Virtues typically use the stat blocks of devas, and they change their forms to conceal their presence while gathering intelligence. It’s possible that a virtue might be able to cast a couple additional spells that are associated with their domain. They can only use commune to answer questions tied to their domain, and can cast plane shift once per day, but only when acting in the direct service of a dominion.</p><h2>Dominions</h2><p>Dominions focus on a very specific aspect of a single domain, like wolves or swords. They have names and specific domains, along with extra titles for pomp—Tezaria, Angel of the Storm, Dominion of the Seventh Spire. They typically spend their time in contemplation and use virtues as their eyes and hands, but occasionally a dominion acts directly—especially if its spire is threatened in some way. As neutral observers, dominions have no sympathy for mortals, but they’re often willing to discuss their domain with a mortal who has an interesting perspective on it.</p><p>It’s important to recognize the difference between a warrior angel of Shavarath and a dominion of Syrania with the domain of War. The Shavaran is an angel who fights wars, and this has no place in peaceful Syrania. On the other hand, the dominion of Syrania—perhaps called the Angel of Swords—understands war, and in particular, knows everything there is to know about a single thing: swords. They know sword-fighting techniques from every mortal and immortal culture. They can recognize any sword, know the locations of a number of long-forgotten legendary blades, and may have a few in their possession. They’re likely one of the deadliest swordfighters in existence, but they don’t actually desire to fight, because that’s not the point: they are the Angel of Swords, and they contemplate swords.</p><p>Dominions often use the statistics of a planetar, substituting the spells and skills as appropriate for their domain; however, they maintain the ability to cast detect good and evil and invisibility at will, and use the latter to move unseen when observing on the Material Plane. Dominions might also possess additional abilities reflecting their absolute knowledge of their domain. For example, the Angel of Swords could be immune to any damage inflicted by a sword; perhaps they know perfectly how to defend against such an attack, or the sword itself might even refuse to strike them.</p><h2>Thrones</h2><p>The greatest angels of Syrania are the thrones. There’s a single throne for each domain, and they have a profound knowledge of their entire domain. Unlike lesser angels, thrones are known only by their domain, with no other name—the Throne of War. They’re bound to all the dominions whose studies lie within their domain, and they know everything experienced by those dominions. They largely remain in deep contemplation, acting only if Syrania itself is threatened or if a dominion succumbs to corruption. A throne has powers equal to or greater than a solar, though when using spells such as commune, it can only answer questions tied to its domain. As a free action, a throne can strip the benefits of Syrania’s Unburdened property for any number of creatures it can see—so flightless creatures who cause trouble may find themselves falling forever through the Open Sky.</p><p>The thrones are the most powerful entities that can be encountered by mortals, but many sages assume that they are themselves tied to a greater force who knows everything that they experience, and who shapes the plane itself.</p><h1>Layers</h1><p>Rather than being divided into separate layers in the same way as many other planes, Syrania is comprised of crystal spires floating in the seemingly infinite void of the Open Sky. The space within a spire may be far larger than it appears from the outside, whether the spire leads to the multiple towers of the University or the vast expanse of the Immeasurable Market. However, all of these regions are connected through the medium of the spires and the Open Sky.</p><p>The majority of spires aren’t all that vast. Most are the seats of a dominion, who is attended by a few virtues and additional angels as needed. These have the general flavor of a library or museum, with additional facilities to allow the dominion to practice or study its subject. The spire of a dominion of nature has gardens, while the tower of a dominion of war has displays of armor and a dueling chamber. But these are still places for study and contemplation; the seat of a dominion of war isn’t an impenetrable fortress, and the spire of a dominion of nature has cultivated gardens, not the wilderness one finds in Irian and Lamannia.</p><h2>The Open Sky</h2><p>The Open Sky is the vast blue expanse from which the Azure Sky takes its name. The clear, bright, sunless sky shows no signs of passing time; the moon Therendor can be seen, but it doesn’t move or have phases. Despite the Open Sky’s seemingly infinite space, it wraps around on itself, effectively making it a 300-mile cube. So while it takes a significant time to travel between the farthest points, it is possible. There are no native threats in the Open Sky, and all visitors to Syrania have the ability to fly; the catch is knowing where to go, as there are hundreds of spires.</p><h2>The University</h2><p>The pursuit of knowledge and education are things that flourish in times of peace. While most dominions are devoted to their own personal contemplation, the Throne of Knowledge maintains the University of Syrania, where chosen students can study an astonishing array of subjects with virtues of knowledge and the occasional guest dominion. The catch is that students need to be admitted... and there isn’t actually a process for applying. At the moment, the University only has twenty students, chosen from across the planes by roaming virtues.</p><p>For planar travelers who come to Syrania, the University is a good repository of general knowledge; if the scholarly virtues can’t help, they’ll likely know the way to a dominion that can. It’s also an unusual background for a player character; perhaps a Divine Soul sorcerer unlocked their powers at the University, or perhaps a warlock’s Celestial patron is their thesis advisor. And it’s a very exotic option for a university group patron...</p><h2>The Immeasurable Market</h2><p>While most planes are isolated from others and it’s difficult to move from one plane to another, commerce and peaceful interaction are defining aspects of Syrania. Most planes have back doors that lead to the Immeasurable Market. The crystal spire in the Open Sky is merely a gateway leading to an open marketplace that extends as far as the eye can see. To one side, a slaadi haggles with a modron over the price of hippogriff eggs; to the other, a sly dao shows a Shavaran balor a selection of Ferniaforged blades. It’s said that anything you can imagine—and many things you can’t—can be found in the Immeasurable Market.</p><p>The Immeasurable Market includes customers and merchants from across the planes, including the Material Plane; there are a few back doors to the Market hidden on Eberron, and those who find them can make a healthy profit trading in exotic goods. It also includes a significant number of native immortals. Angels work as servers and porters, while virtues of commerce run small stands and shops. Dominions of commerce run the largest and most reliable businesses, while the Throne of Commerce monitors the entire Market and banishes troublemakers.</p><p>There are countless merchants in the Market. Most have temporary stands or tents, but there are a few permanent structures scattered about; the Last Resort is the most beloved watering hole in the planes.</p><p>Violence is forbidden in the Market, and thieves and other criminals are generally deported to Daanvi for judgment and punishment. While merchants always try to get the best deal, when dealing with immortal customers, your reputation is everything. Beyond this, oaths made in the Market carry great weight, and can be enforced in the courts of Daanvi; in the Immeasurable Market, your word truly is your bond. This is important, because most of the merchants aren’t interested in gold, and goods and services usually involve barter. </p><h1>Syranian Stories</h1><p>Wandering angels can stumble into any story, and the Immeasurable Market is a boon for adventurers lucky enough to find it. The Last Resort can be an interesting place for a powerful enemy to arrange a meeting; what safer place for neutral negotiations than on the plane of peace? Given the versatility and opportunities available in the Immeasurable Market, a DM may wish to limit access to Syrania; even if adventurers find a back door, it could open only at certain times or require a particular sacrifice.</p><h2>Curious Virtue</h2><p>After the adventurers acquire a curious object that defies any attempt to divine its powers and history, a hireling or observer is revealed to be a Syranian angel that’s observing the adventurers. The item is a powerful extraplanar artifact; the virtue doesn’t want to take it from them, but rather, to observe the effect it has on its bearer and the world around them. The virtue is the key to unlocking the powers of this powerful artifact... but how do the characters feel about being subjects of a celestial case study?</p><h2>Pursuit through the Market</h2><p>An enemy of the adventurers has been making use of powerful and exotic weapons— Shavaran explosives, a Mabaran shadow-blade, Fernia-forged armor. The adventurers corner the supplier, but they escape through a portal, and when the characters pursue, they find themselves in the Immeasurable Market. Can they find their foe in the Market? If so, how will they deal with them in a realm where violence is all but impossible?</p><h2>Celestial Knowledge</h2><p>The adventurers need to obtain a particularly obscure piece of information, and the only being that might possess it is a dominion of knowledge in Syrania. Can the adventurers find a way to reach the celestial’s library spire? What does it want in exchange for its knowledge— and will the adventurers try to pay this price, or steal the information they need?</p><h1>Fallen Angels</h1><p>Syranian virtues sometimes travel to the Material Plane to conduct research for their dominion, concealing their true nature through magic or invisibility, and trying to minimize their interactions with mortals. Occasionally, a dominion wishes to experience the Material Plane for itself, perhaps pursuing a lead or studying a particularly interesting group of subjects. However, this venture can be quite dangerous, for even angels fall.</p><p>Many sages believe that touching Eberron’s ground makes angels vulnerable to the influence of Khyber and the overlords, while others theorize that mortal worship—the positive energy that sustains the Undying Court—is like a drug to the dominions. Whatever the cause, dominions who interact with mortals run the risk of becoming corrupted. Such immortals crave mortal adoration and often seek to dominate mortals by exercising the power of their sphere.</p><p>Not all dominions fall prey to this corruption, but once one does, there seems to be no way to undo it. Even if the angel is destroyed and reforms, the corruption remains. It’s unlikely that such an angel would be met in Syrania itself; typically, these corrupted angels are forever stripped of the power of flight and condemned to walk the Material Plane as radiant idols.</p><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1600000,"name":"Thelanis: The Faerie Court","type":"text","_id":"Psi9bxGt4DqqA3rl","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><section class=\"traits\"><p>Flowing</p><p>Immeasurable</p></section><hr /><p><strong>Moon </strong>Rhaan, the Book<br /><strong>Moon and Portal Color</strong> Pale blue<br /><strong>Native Inhabitants</strong> Supporting Cast, Eladrin and other mortals, Greater Fey, Archfey and Anchor Barons</p><hr /><blockquote><p>Every culture has faerie tales— stories that use exaggeration and supernatural elements to warn children of the consequences of bad behavior or to demonstrate the virtues of society. Breland tells tales of the Sleeping Prince, cursed to slumber by a cruel hag until he’s saved by the courage of the Woodcutter’s Daughter. In the Mror Holds, there’s a tale older than Breland itself, in which Lady Narathun curses Doldarun’s son with eternal sleep, until he’s saved by humble Toldorath. And the Dhakaani dar have an ancient story about how Hezhaal—a dirge singer who betrayed the empire and studied sinister magic—cast the marhu’s son into a cursed slumber, until he was saved by a simple golin’dar.</p></blockquote><p>This is just one of many stories that appear over and over in different cultures. The exact details may shift—is the sleeper a prince? The marhu’s son? Doldarun’s heir?—while the thrust of the tale and the lessons it teaches persist. But long before any of these cultures arose, these stories existed somewhere else. In a layer of Thelanis, the Lady in Shadow curses a prince with eternal sleep. She tends a garden full of wonders, and keeps her own daughter hidden in the heart of a labyrinth of thorns. At the deepest level, that is what the fey are: stories. The dryad isn’t a natural spirit; it’s the magic we want in the world when we see a slender tree move in the wind and imagine it as a beautiful person. Thelanis is built on iconic stories, but it’s also the Faerie Court; at its heart, satyrs and nymphs dance in the shadows of the Palace of the Moon, while the archfey engage in immortal intrigues. It’s a fantastic realm essentially built around the idea of adventures, but it’s a deadly place for those who refuse to understand its rules.</p><p>Thelanis is one of the easiest planes for mortals to reach. Just walk through a mushroom ring when Rhaan is full in the sky, or follow the sound of distant music in the forest. It’s not always this easy, but it can be. One wrong step and you could find yourself in Thelanis, retracing the steps of storybook heroes and making dangerous bargains with the rulers of the Faerie Court.</p><h1>Manifest Zones</h1><p>More than with any other plane, Thelanian manifest zones often allow travel between the planes. Fey creatures dwell in such zones, and a greater fey may turn such a manifest zone into its personal domain. Just as fey can cross over from Thelanis, mortals can travel to the Faerie Court. Gateway zones always share the general environment of the layer they are connected to, though it’s rarely obvious when this passage occurs, and it may take time for travelers to realize they have crossed over. However, there are always signs of a gateway—circles of mushrooms, strange patterns of vegetation, eerie lights, or faint, unearthly music the adventurers must follow. Gateways typically only activate at certain times— often when the moon Rhaan is full—and even then, there’s usually something that must be done that violates a known superstition. If you stay on the path in the forest, you won’t stumble into the Endless Weald. But if you follow the ghostly music, or chase the silvery deer? That’s on you.</p><p>Other manifest zones reflect the properties and influence of Thelanis without allowing passage between worlds. Zones with the Enchanted Realm property are much sought after by House Phiarlan and House Thuranni. Zones with Storybook Logic break the rules of reality in specific ways; the Grove of Promises is a clearing that holds an old stone fountain. Stories from the nearby village say that if you make a promise to someone and then share a drink from the fountain, you must keep your word—and if you are false, you’ll sicken and die. The people of the town perform marriages in the Grove. Young lovers sneak away to pledge their hearts. There are even merchants who like to seal their deals in the Grove. The people of the town never break a promise sworn in the Grove . . . will you?</p><p>A final form of manifest zone is the beachhead; this phenomenon periodically draws a piece of Thelanis into Eberron. The feyspires mentioned earlier are an example of this, but a beachhead can be any unusual location—sure to be a local legend, but rarely be found by those searching for it, only uncovered by chance. There’s a tale in the Mror Holds of the Tomb of the Forgotten King, found when a traveler seeks shelter in a cave and discovers deeper passages. Following these tunnels, they find themselves in an ancient tomb. Jewels are embedded in the walls. Coins are heaped on tables, spilling onto the floor. In some versions of the story, guardians patrol the tomb, spirits of stone and metal. In others, there are deadly traps. But one detail remains the same throughout all the tales: treasures taken from the tomb always bring misfortune, bestowing curses that linger until the thief finds the tomb again and returns what they have stolen . . . or until they die.</p><h1>Coterminous and Remote</h1><p>When Thelanis is coterminous, new gateway zones spring up. Mischievous or cruel fey may cross over, and it’s far easier for careless travelers to cross over. However, there are always warning signs, and you generally must break some superstition or taboo to be pulled through. Thus, when people know the planes are coterminous, they are cautious to remember the stories and avoid foolish behavior.</p><p>When Thelanis is remote, the effects of Thelanian manifest zones are suppressed. Fey creatures may be temporarily drawn back to Thelanis, even those that normally dwell on Eberron. In general, the world feels less magical.</p><p>Traditionally, Thelanis becomes coterminous for a period of 7 years every 225 years, and it is remote for 7 years halfway between these cycles. However, there is evidence, such as beachheads remaining in place longer than usual, that something has disrupted this cycle. This may be a result of the Mourning . . . or it could be that the Mourning is just an easy excuse, and the true story is tied to the schemes of an archfey or a mortal mastermind. Nonetheless, no one knows when Thelanis will become coterminous again—or how long the phase might last when it does</p><h1>Planar Effects</h1><p>Thelanis is unpredictable, and its cardinal rule is that layers follow their own stories. Consider the following properties.</p><h2>Enchanted Realm</h2><p>Creatures take a -2 status penalty to saving throws against any spells or abilities with the illusion trait. When a creature casts an illusion spell, its range is doubled; if that spell has a duration of at least 1 minute but less than 24 hours, the duration is also doubled.</p><h2>Storybook Logic</h2><p>No two layers of Thelanis are exactly alike. While these effects vary from layer to layer, they are entirely reliable within that layer and should feel logical based on the nature of the local story. Damage types could be swapped or rendered impotent, a particular skill could have status bonuses or penalties, or items could behave in unexpected ways.</p><h2>Words Have Power</h2><p>In Thelanis, words - and particularly promises - have power. Creatures should be very careful about making formal agreements of any sort, especially with archfey; the more powerful the fey, the graver the consequences of breaking a promise.</p><h2>Chaotic Time</h2><p>Time is entirely flexible in Thelanis, moving at different rates from layer to layer. While time may have passed faster or slower than expected while in Thelanis, often time catches up with mortals when they return to Eberron - either swiftly ageing them if more time has passed on the Material Plane, or potentially restoring their youth and erasing the decades spent in Thelanis.</p><h1>Denizens</h1><p>Thelanis is home to fey in all their forms. Sprites flit between trees, singing to the dryads that dwell within them. There are birds in the trees, and if you talk to them, one might answer— either a bird or a tree, depending on the story. Most of the denizens of Thelanis fall into one of four categories.</p><h2>Supporting Cast</h2><p>The vast majority of the creatures of Thelanis—the sprites in the forest, the dryads, the birds, and for that matter, the trees themselves—are manifestations. These members of the supporting cast exist because the story needs them to exist, and they have a specific role to play. While most supporting cast are fey, any creature can appear if the story requires it. A pack of wolves? An angry giant? A white horse that appears just when it’s needed? Anything is possible.</p><p>Supporting cast generally use the standard stat blocks for each creature, though they might be considered fey instead of other creature types. These creatures don’t think of themselves as manifestations; it’s simply that they have no real depth, no desires other than the drives they need to fill their role in the story, and no care for the passage of time. The sprite never gets bored of its song, and it never stops to question anything about its existence.</p><p>The supporting cast reflects the fact that the stories of Thelanis don’t change. The hungry giant will always be guarding the well. If adventurers defeat the giant, they’re the heroes of the hour and it feels like a triumph; but if they return to the barony at a later date, the giant will be back—or at least, a remarkably similar giant—and it won’t remember them or acknowledge their previous victory. As a general rule, supporting cast can’t abandon their posts or leave their layers.</p><p>However, more than the manifestations of other planes, the supporting cast of Thelanis can evolve. When an anchor baron gives the white horse to an adventurer, it becomes a mortal horse and they can ride it home. Supporting cast that drift into manifest zones become mortal fey, dwelling in the zone until they die. A supporting cast member can also evolve by gaining a greater role in the story. An individual sprite doesn’t even have a name, but if the adventurers convince the sprite to help them, and it plays a critical role in their defeat of the giant at the well, it’s no longer a nameless sprite; it’s Clever Jack, or whatever name they gave it. If a manifestation becomes mortal, it can go anywhere it likes, even leaving its layer and following the adventurers back to Eberron . . . but if it dies, it’s gone forever. On the other hand, a manifestation can evolve to become a greater fey; if this happens, it remains immortal, and it’s still tied to its story, just with a bigger role and more personality</p><h2>Eladrin and Other Mortals</h2><p>There are two types of mortals in Thelanis. The first are the supporting cast that have become real and split off from their original stories. The second are natural-born mortals who do have their own cultures and cities; chief among these are the eladrin, who dwell in the feyspires of the Moonlit Vale. Each spire is ruled by an archfey, and each has a distinct story that shapes the personality of the local eladrin. The eladrin aren’t as bound by story as other fey, but the magic of the plane encourages a deep devotion to their spire and their ruler. They hunt, they hold revels, they serve their ruler in the intrigues of the Moon Court; it rarely occurs to them that there could be more to life. However, they’re indeed mortals; they fall in love, they have children, they are born, and they die. If an eladrin leaves their spire—whether to roam across Thelanis or into Eberron—they often gain a greater appreciation of the passage of time. Living among mortals in a mundane world can be a hard transition for an eladrin; compared to the wonders of the Faerie Court, there is little fey beauty in Khorvaire. The longer an eladrin lives in the mortal world, the more mortal it becomes; this is why eladrin player characters are considered humanoids (and elves) rather than fey.</p><p>For the eladrin of Thelanis, the seasonal aspect remains a statement of their current mood and nature. However, seasons are also used as a political statement, reflecting a degree of support for that season in the Moon Court; there may be times when an eladrin will resist assuming a particular aspect so as not to offend a host.</p><p>The eladrin are the most common mortals in the layer, but there are also a handful of mortals who have been drawn in from Eberron—the gnomes of Pylas Pyrial, wandering Greensingers, mortals personally chosen by one of the archfey, or creatures who accidentally wandered through manifest zones and are trying to find their way home.</p><h2>Greater Fey</h2><p>Greater fey are tied to a barony or have a role in the Moonlit Vale, but they have their own names, identities, and distinct personalities. They can have their own agendas and schemes within the grander story of the archfey, seeking love or revenge or other ambitions. Sometimes the protagonist of the story appears as a greater fey; in the case of the Sleeping Prince, perhaps the adventurers can actually meet the clever Woodcutter’s Daughter. However, often the role of protagonist is left for the adventurers to fill; in Thelanis, they are the ones who must wake the Sleeping Prince.</p><p>Despite their individuality, these greater fey are still fey; they remain attached to their layers, and don’t experience the passage of time as mortals do. They want to achieve things within their story, but few have any thoughts or desires that go beyond Thelanis. However, it’s possible for them to go wherever they want. A greater fey could establish its own domain in a manifest zone tied to Thelanis, or be found selling strange trinkets in the Immeasurable Market of Syrania. When greater fey do leave Thelanis, they generally seek to create their own stories; they still want to be part of a narrative that makes sense to them.</p><p>Any fey creature can be used as a basic foundation for a greater fey, possibly with additional powers tied to the story they tell. A greater dryad might be able to see through all of the trees in the manifest zone she calls home, and to control its beasts. This isn’t represented by a spell, as she couldn’t control beasts in other places; it’s simply part of the story.</p><p>As the story of a greater fey grows, its abilities can grow as well... but these are often tied to storybook logic, and power could be balanced by a weakness. A greater dryad could be immune to fire unless someone knows her name, at which point she is vulnerable to it. Or she might be immune to piercing damage but vulnerable to slashing damage—arrows and spears refuse to strike her, but axes hunger to cut her down.</p><h2>Archfey and Anchor Barons</h2><p>The archfey are the foundation of Thelanis, the force that sets a story in motion. Where greater fey may be tied to a single story, most archfey have inspired countless tales—often as the antagonist, though they can also be benevolent. The Lady in Shadow is the archetype of the mighty witch who lives apart from society, whose anger can bring a terrible curse. She’s the villain of the Sleeping Prince, but she also curses those who steal from her secret garden, and may have advice for those who approach her carefully and with gifts. In some cases, stories refer to the archfey by name. When something goes missing in the Five Nations, people in Eberron know the Forgotten Prince stole it. Other archfey inspire tales, but those stories are seen through a local lens. The Lady in Shadow set the story of the Sleeping Prince in motion long ago, but in Eberron, the villain of the story is Lady Narathun, or Hezhaal the dirge singer, or Sora Katra. This is fine with the Lady in Shadow; she doesn’t need mortals to know her name.</p><p>Many archfey dwell in the Moonlit Vale. Some rule over feyspires, while others dwell in the Palace of the Moon; the intrigues of the Court are their defining stories. Archfey that rule layers are known as anchor barons, as each is the anchor that defines the barony. They come to the Palace of the Moon for revels or conclaves, but prefer to dwell in their own story.</p><p>Archfey possess great power within Thelanis and its manifest zones, but to act in the world beyond, they need agents. Some recruit agents directly, working with Greensingers or training warlocks or other emissaries; an archfey could serve as an immortal group patron for a group of adventurers. Typically, an archfey wants its agents to take actions relating to its story; the Forgotten Prince charges his agents to steal secrets and unloved things. Others don’t want agents; they want mortals to reenact their stories, as in many versions of the Sleeping Prince. Hezhaal the dirge singer really did curse the marhu’s son long ago, and Sora Katra is another real person who just happens to resemble the Lady in Shadow in some ways. Neither Katra nor Hezhaal knowingly served the Lady in Shadow—but she may have secretly aided them, or placed gifts or obstacles in their paths that might make them reenact the stories, unknowingly becoming avatars of the archfey. Archfey can’t be permanently killed; as long as their stories are told, the archfey will reform. However, this usually involves a greater fey being promoted to fill the role; the archfey still exists, but they aren’t exactly the same as the one that came before.</p><p>The following are a few examples of known Archfey of Thelanis:</p><h3>The Forest Queen</h3><p>The Forest Queen reflects the mystery and danger of the dark woods. She is protective of her beasts and despises the encroaching cities. In her tales, she rewards those who respect the wilds and show kindness to her beasts, but she is cruel to fools who stray from the path or hurt her subjects.</p><h3>The Forgotten Prince</h3><p>The Forgotten Prince steals things that are forgotten or unappreciated, hoarding them in his castle. This can be done to teach a lesson—in many tales, people don’t appreciate something until after the Prince steals it—but other times, the Prince is merely indulging his own desires.</p><h3>The Lady in Shadow</h3><p>The Lady in Shadow is the witch who stands outside society, possessing dangerous knowledge and power. She curses those who offend her or steal her things, but her knowledge can be quite valuable—if she is approached with care.</p><h3>The Harvest Monarch</h3><p>The Harvest Monarch is tied to the land they govern. When their people suffer, they’re sickly. In prosperous times, they’re strong and vital. Sometimes they’re deposed and forced to walk their land in hiding; during these times, they’re known as the Long Wanderer or the Exile. But they’re the rightful ruler and are always restored, and those who aid them are rewarded.</p><h3>The Mother of Invention</h3><p>The Mother of Invention is a brilliant artisan. What she invents depends on the story; she can be an alchemist, a smith, or even a wizard devising new spells. She often creates things that solve problems, but other stories begin when she creates something that causes a problem—a metal beast that ravages the land, or a potion of immortality that doesn’t grant eternal youth. Depending on her depiction, she’s also known as the Forge Maiden.</p><h3>The Second Son</h3><p>The Second Son is the jealous heir who stands just beyond the claim to a title. He is always scheming to usurp power or steal the things that belong to others. In most tales, his gambits ultimately end in failure, further driving his bitterness. His formal title in the Moon Court is the Count of the Barren Marches, as his lands are always inferior to those of his siblings.</p><h3>Fortune’s Fool</h3><p>Fortune’s Fool is forever stumbling into a new disaster, though miraculously she invariably emerges unscathed. Her arrival usually bodes ill for those unfortunate enough to be around her, though sometimes others can profit from the chaos that follows in her wake. Her formal title in the Moon Court is Lady Perilous.</p><h3>The Prince of Frost</h3><p>The Prince of Frost was once the Prince of Summer, but his heart froze when his beloved fled with a mortal hero. The escaping lovers cast their spirits forward in time, and the Prince waits in his castle of frozen tears for their return and his revenge. Until then, he torments all virtuous heroes who cross his path, reflecting the story of a good person turned cruel by loss.</p><h1>Layers</h1><p>Much like Kythri, Dal Quor, and Syrania, Thelanis has a core layer surrounded by lesser layers. The heart of Thelanis is the Moonlit Vale, where all archfey gather for their revels. This is surrounded by endless baronies, each embodying the stories of a particular archfey. While eladrin and fey can shift between layers, it’s more challenging for mortals to travel to a barony; this often requires a token from that realm, or for the mortals to act out some aspect of its story.</p><p>Regardless of the specific identity of a layer, Thelanis always feels magical and otherworldy. Its environments are typically vibrant and beautiful, but if they are harsh and ugly, they are exceptionally so. It feels like a story, exaggerated and unreal.</p><h2>The Moonlit Vale</h2><p>This is the largest layer of Thelanis and the heart of the plane. The Moonlit Vale is essentially a country, with the feyspires spread across it as cities; it’s possible to spend days traveling from spire to spire. While it’s largely arboreal, there are beautiful valleys, glittering lakes, and a vast mountain. It’s always night here, and the moon Rhaan radiates bright light, always seeming to hang just above the viewer. While the moon doesn’t move or change, the seasons do; in winter, the court is covered in snow, while in spring, it’s in brilliant flower. This has nothing to do with the passage of time, and everything to do with the intrigues of the Palace of the Moon; the current season indicates which seasonal court is currently dominant. This is a crucial aspect of the Moonlit Vale: things change. The baronies are fixed in their stories, but the intrigues of the four seasons are the story Thelanis tells itself.</p><p>The Moonlit Vale embodies the general idea of the fey— otherworldy beauty and magic. There are many natural displays of illusion— streams of glowing mist, ethereal music, distant song. Motes of light drift slowly through the trees. The beasts of the region are sleek and graceful, and have unusual colors and patterns; while many use standard stat blocks, sentient beasts might use the statistics for Valenar beasts from Eberron: Rising from the Last War (though these aren’t in any way related to the Tairnadal). The land is fertile, game is easy to hunt, and adventurers have advantage on foraging checks . . . though hunting without permission may incur the wrath of the local fey.</p><p>The grandest city in the Moonlit Vale is the Palace of the Moon. Its towers are built into the trunks of four vast trees, each one reflecting the influence of a particular season. The Summer Tree is in full bloom, while the Winter Tree is withered and bare. The four seasons are factions among the fey of the Moon Court, and those who dwell within the palace live within the tree of their season. The palace is full of endless intrigues, and envoys negotiate alliances with the feyspires and the anchor barons. To mortals, many of these intrigues would seem trivial and strange, but for the fey, they determine the ruling season, which sets the tone for the layer. At the apex of each season—perhaps a strangely arbitrary declaration in a realm with such a casual relationship to time—the fey of the ruling season host a grand revel, which draws archfey from all throughout the plane; this is a moment when intrigues bloom and stories are shaped, a time for duels and grand declarations.</p><p>The feyspires are the cities of the Moonlit Vale. Each is home to a single archfey whose personal story is reflected by the spire, along with a few greater fey and a host of eladrin and other mortals. Many feyspires serve as planar beachheads; they are tied to specific manifest zones in Eberron, and when the time is right, they can slip into Eberron for a short time. Usually the feyspires are hidden by powerful illusions during these times, but there are stories of people stumbling into magical cities that are gone the next day. In fourth edition, the Eberron Campaign Guide explored the idea that feyspires could be trapped in Eberron following the Mourning; it’s up to a DM to decide if that’s the story they want to tell. Here are a few notable feyspires:</p><ul><li><strong>Pylas Pyrial</strong> is the Gate of Joy, celebrated for its bards and revels. Tied to Zilargo, it has a significant gnome population.</li><li><strong>Shae Joridal</strong> is the City of Emerald Lights; its illusionists are legendary. It appears in what is now Darguun.</li><li><strong>Shae Loralyndar</strong> is the City of Rose and Thorn, an arboreal spire frequently found in the Twilight Demesne of the Eldeen Reaches. Many Greensingers have close ties to this city.</li><li><strong>Shae Tirias Tolai</strong> is the City of Silver and Bone. Tied to Xen’drik, it was sacked by the giants of the Cul’sir Dominion and never reclaimed; some believe the elves of Eberron are descended from the eladrin of Shae Tirias Tolai. Today, it’s a haunted ruin, shunned by the fey.</li><li><strong>Shaelas Tiraleth</strong> is the Court of the Silver Tree, largest of the feyspires. Its ruler, Shan Tira, is a master diviner and gifted oracle. All archfey respect her words, and she serves as a mediator between the seasons of the Moon Court. The spire is tied to Cyre, and there are stories that suggest the first Princess Cyre herself may have been a student of Shan Tira.</li><li><strong>Taer Syraen</strong> is the Winter Citadel, seat of the Prince of Frost. This martial spire appears in a barren region of Karrnath. It’s closely allied with the winter fey of the Moon Court.</li></ul><h2>The Baronies</h2><p>Each barony is a collection of layers that embody the stories of their anchor baron. Only one archfey is found in each barony, and it is a serious transgression for another archfey to enter a barony uninvited, as their presence disrupts the story. Each barony is unique, but the layers are often quite small, reflecting the events of a familiar tale . . . though not all of the stories of Thelanis are known to every culture in Khorvaire! A few are described below, but there are many more.</p><p>The Assembly is the barony of the Forge Maiden. Here, innovation is celebrated, and any artificer spell cast in this layer is treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. But while there are a few stories of how things go well, there are many where inventions go terribly wrong: the construct dragon that has claimed the workshop and gathered a hoard; the labyrinth the Maiden designed so well that she became lost in it; the time stop spell that can’t be undone. Wondrous (and impossible) artifacts can be found here, but so can many dangers.</p><p>The Shadow is the barony of the Lady in Shadow, with branches reflecting the many tales of this sinister figure. It includes a tiny kingdom, which serves as the set for the Sleeping Prince and similar tales; the kingdom is often named Whitestone, though this can change. The secret garden of the Lady is walled and protected by dangerous plant creatures, but holds imaginary flowers that an alchemist could use to do amazing things. The Lady’s tower is hidden within a maze of thorns. Any story dealing with a sinister spellcaster dwelling on the edge of civilization could be found here.</p><p>Folly is the barony of Fortune’s Fool. Here, great misfortunes regularly occur, but invariably lead to unlikely success. In this layer, d20 rolls of 5 or below are always considered a 1, and rolls of 16 or above are always considered a 20. Folly contains a charming village and a number of threats—a dragon, a giant— that can’t be defeated with weapons alone. However, skill checks can be used to achieve things that might seem impossible in reality. For example, each Persuasion or Deception check could be used to convince the dragon to eat its own hoard, with each successful check reducing its hit points until it bursts. This is a place where wits are more important than brawn, though it may take time for the adventurers to discover this.</p><h1>Thelanian Stories</h1><p>Thelanian stories can start before a campaign begins. With the DM’s permission, any character or party could be connected to an archfey, for better or for worse. Here are a few examples.</p><h2>The Patron </h2><p>Whether serving as patron for a warlock or an entire party, an archfey could work with adventurers, providing magical benefits—perhaps spells from the artificer or bard lists, or boons and magic items—in exchange for the character’s services. It could be that the patron’s goals are tied to the intrigues of the Moon Court or to some element of its story. It might want the characters to deal with the warlock agents of another archfey. Or it could be that the archfey is trying to get the adventurers to reenact its story in the present day, to have a character serve as an avatar for the archfey— or as the avatar for one of its enemies.</p><h2>Blessing or Curse?</h2><p>You don’t have to be a warlock to draw powers from an archfey. An artificer could have been blessed by the Forge Maiden; their artifice isn’t arcane science, they simply create impossible, whimsical things. A barbarian’s rage could be a curse from the Lady in Shadow, laid upon an ancestor and handed down through generations. All other members of the character’s family have eventually been killed by their fury; does the barbarian seek to break the curse, or do they just want to live as wild a life as possible before it consumes them?</p><h2>Faerie Tales</h2><p>The archfey and the baronies are the source of faerie tales. You can draw from beloved tales in our own world to craft any adventure, adding an Eberron twist. Using these tropes gives the players a sense of familiarity with the story, just as the people of Eberron are familiar with these archetypal tales, played out time and time again across cultures and generations. So, the Sleeping Prince clearly follows the same basic principles as Sleeping Beauty or Snow White, but with an Eberron twist—it’s Sora Katra and the prince of Breland!</p><h2>The Actual Changeling</h2><p>As a child, any character could have wandered through a manifest zone, stumbled into a feyspire, or even caught the eye of an archfey and been carried off to Thelanis. A bard could have learned their craft in Pylas Pyrial. A druid’s abilities might be tied less to nature and more to the magic of the fey. It might be that a warlock doesn’t have a patron, but they’re the adopted child of the Lady in Shadow and learned her tricks by watching her. If this is the case, is the character welcome to one day return to Thelanis, or were they cast out of it? Did the Lady in Shadow encourage her child to leave, or did the adventurer escape from the maze of thorns where they were held prisoner (for their own good, of course)? Does the character have a fey lover or rival in Thelanis?</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":1700000,"name":"Xoriat: The Realm of Madness","type":"text","_id":"V6QIldCSteZbZOod","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<hr /><section class=\"traits\"><p>Erratic</p><p>Immeasurable</p></section><hr /><p><strong>Moon </strong>Lharvion, the Eye<br /><strong>Moon and Portal Color</strong> Dull white with large black chasm crossing it<br /><strong>Native Inhabitants</strong> The Daelkyr, Aberrations</p><hr /><blockquote><p>The touch of Xoriat will warp your flesh and corrupt your mind. The inhabitants of this alien realm seek to transform or destroy all that is natural, and even the slightest contact with it is dangerous.</p></blockquote><p>At least, that’s the popular opinion—but it’s not entirely true. The plane’s title, “Realm of Madness,” is a label applied by the people of Eberron based on the perception that close interaction with Xoriat can interfere with your ability to process reality. But illithids call Xoriat the Realm of Revelations . . . and this may be more accurate. Where Lamannia embodies the natural world, Xoriat instead embodies the unnatural. It’s a window into the workings of reality that mortals normally don’t see, ones they’re ill-equipped to handle. It suggests that time and space, order and chaos, war and peace—all of these are inventions. They’re the foundations mortal lives are built on . . . but what lies under those foundations? What was there before the house was built, and what will come after? Xoriat holds the answers to those questions, and infinitely more as well.</p><p>Though the fact is often overlooked, all mortals have a connection to Xoriat. Mortals dream in Dal Quor. Shavarath sparks mortal anger. Mabar feeds mortal shadows, while Irian holds their spark of light. When mortals die, their souls are drawn to Dolurrh. Mortals are influenced by all of the planes, and the influence of Xoriat drives the desire to question reality. It can be a source of inspiration, especially for artists; it helps people challenge their assumptions and see things in an entirely new way. But Xoriat’s also the sun that melts the wings of any who draw too close. From a distance, its influence can be a positive force, but mortals who gaze too deeply into Xoriat can lose touch with their native reality, losing the ability to navigate the natural world. So Xoriat is a deeply dangerous place, but the plane itself isn’t evil or destructive. It’s part of the universal balance, as important as any of the other concepts of the planes. Irian brings life, Lamannia is the blueprint for nature, Daanvi provides guiding order. Xoriat is a glimpse at what lies behind and beyond, of the other ways reality could have been—and of the unseen ways it is .</p><h1>Manifest Zones</h1><p>The seals of the Gatekeepers block travel to Xoriat, but there are still many ways the Realm of Madness can affect the world.</p><p>Manifest zones tied to Xoriat are common in the Shadow Marches, but rare elsewhere. The effects of a Xorian manifest zone are rarely as dramatic as the alien attributes of the plane itself. However, manifest zones may convey one or more of the universal properties of the plane. The most common is the Dangerous Revelations property. People who linger in a Xorian zone often find alien concepts creeping into their brains, instilling strange beliefs, or twisting their sense of reality. These zones can easily produce cults of the Dragon Below; in the Shadow Marches, the Gatekeepers struggle to keep people out of these zones, while Marcher cultists consider them to be sacred sites. Unpredictable Magic is another common property; such zones often have unnatural flora or fauna, but these effects are unreliable and change with each generation. The properties of Time Is an Illusion and Strange Reality are rare in manifest zones, and may not be active all the time; these effects might only become active when Lharvion is full, or when disturbing rituals are performed.</p><h1>Coterminous and Remote</h1><p>The last time Xoriat was coterminous, the daelkyr brought their armies through the walls of reality and laid waste to the Empire of Dhakaan. The seals crafted long ago by the Gatekeeper druids keep the daelkyr bound in Khyber, but they also keep Xoriat from becoming coterminous. Xoriat’s remote phases have no known effect, and like Kythri, they’re unpredictable, though the phases tend to come and go far more slowly than Kythri’s do. There are no recorded instances of citizens of the Five Nations visiting Xoriat; most scholars believe that the Gatekeeper seals prevent all planar travel... though someone may have secretly built an eldritch machine in a manifest zone, perhaps incorporating illithid brains or the position of the moon Lharvion. What would happen if the adventurers stumbled on a cult of the Dragon Below just as the cult completes its sinister rituals?</p><h1>Planar Effects</h1><p>To mortal eyes, Xoriat may seem more chaotic than Kythri. However, it’s not defined by the idea of chaos; rather, mortals don’t understand the logic that guides its changes. Additionally, Kythri’s constant change is still always natural: fire and lightning, stone and water. On the other hand, in Xoriat, a tornado might be composed of ink. Each grain in a sandstorm could be a miniature bust of Queen Aurala of Aundair, or a tiny beating heart. It’s not simply chaotic; it’s unnatural.</p><h2>Unpredictable Magic </h2><p>Immediately after a creature casts a spell of 1st level of higher, roll on the \"Wellspring Surges\" table from The Secrets of Magic, regardless of if the creature possess the wellspring magic archetype or not.</p><h2>Dangerous Revelations</h2><p>Whenever a creature rests for 8 hours or is reduced to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 20 Will saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is exposed to a madness-inducing effect. It may learn a terrible secret, or fundamentally change its vision of reality. The creature becomes Stupefied 1 and may not reduce this value until it escapes this planar effect.</p><h2>Time Is an Illusion</h2><p>Time is unreliable in Xoriat. Adventurers could be trapped in the Realm of Madness for what feels like a lifetime, then find only a moment has passed on Eberron. It’s even possible for them to return to Eberron before they left.</p><p>Strange Reality The things adventurers rely on - gravity, time, their identity itself - aren’t always reliable in Xoriat. These properties frequently change in ways that are near impossible to predict.</p><h1>Xoriat and the Maze of Reality</h1><p>There’s a logic to the structure of the planes. Irian is the beginning, where new seeds are born. Mabar is the end, consuming all things. Time sometimes moves at different rates in different planes, but it always moves forward . . . except in Xoriat.</p><p>Imagine time as a maze and the Material Plane as a rat moving through it, with the other planes worn as a crown. This is how the Draconic Prophecy works. It doesn’t tell you what will happen, because that hasn’t been decided yet. It’s a roadmap to the maze, revealing that if you take a left turn at “Queen Aurala is assassinated” and then turn right at “Breland becomes a democracy,” you’ll reach “Sul Khatesh is released from her prison.” The Prophecy shows the path you need to take to achieve the outcome you desire—a map to the many possibilities of the future.</p><p>But Xoriat isn’t bound to the rat. It hovers above the maze. And adventurers could return to the wrong time when they leave it, falling farther back in the maze. They could find themselves in the Empire of Dhakaan, or in the midst of the War of the Mark. And in the process, they could change the future. Perhaps they help Halas Tarkanan win the War of the Mark; the dragonmarked houses are broken and scattered before they ever achieve their current glory, and people with aberrant dragonmarks thrive. With these changes, modern Khorvaire would be a very different place. In doing this, the adventurers have dropped a new rat in the maze. This new rat becomes the Prime Material Plane. It snatches the old rat’s crown of planes, becoming the reality where all the planes converge and where time moves forward. But the other rat is still out there—forgotten and lost, huddled in a corner, but still alive. And it’s possible that if the adventurers return to Xoriat, they could change their mind; they could find their way back to that original rat, returning it to its role as the Prime Material Plane. So Xoriat gives the possibility for dramatic change— but it’s always possible to restore a forgotten past.</p><p>This view is critical to understanding the daelkyr. They stand above the maze, but they can also descend into it. They experiment on the rat, changing it. What happens if they make too many changes? It’s possible the rat might crawl into a corner to die and a new rat be released: perhaps the old Prime is lost and a new world moves forward. This is what the gith believe happened with their world, as described in the section on Kythri. The gith lived on a world that was once the Prime Material Plane. Now it may just be another rat lost and forgotten in the maze. Should the daelkyr rise and complete their work, it’s possible the current Eberron could be torn away from the planes; it would still exist, but as a forgotten shadow of the new central reality that takes its place.</p><p>If this doesn’t entirely make sense, that’s appropriate. Most scholars in Khorvaire would call this theory madness, and so Xoriat receives its name. But others might say that this is in keeping with the myth of the Progenitors. Irian is the beginning, Mabar is the end—and Xoriat could be the point that stands above the journey, the high perch from which the Progenitors could study their work. Xoriat isn’t bound by the laws that bind the rest of the planes, and it holds all the ideas that were discarded. Perhaps the Sovereigns didn’t entirely build reality, but rather, they sculpted it—chipping things away and dropping them into Xoriat.</p><p>This is a metaphysical discussion that most adventurers will never need to worry about. There are three things to take away from it. Xoriat is a point from which history and reality itself can be changed. The daelkyr have changed it an unknown number of times. And from Xoriat, it’s possible for adventurers to either change it themselves—or to undo damage they might have done.</p><h1>Denizens</h1><p>In Xoriat, there are masses of swirling colors, hues never seen on Eberron. There are ripples in space that disrupt time in their wake. There are bursts of powerful emotion that drift across layers. These may well be alive in some way—but there’s no way to communicate with them. This section discusses some of the creatures most relevant to adventurers. While the plane might hold other forces that could be considered alive, their thought processes would almost certainly be fundamentally inhuman, and they wouldn’t recognize organic beings as life.</p><h2>The Daelkyr</h2><p>The daelkyr came to Eberron to corrupt it and transform its people, and they crippled the Dhakaani Empire before being bound in Khyber. Six are known by name, but there are surely others. They remain trapped in Khyber to this day, waiting for the chance to rise and finish the work they began . . . and perhaps to pave the way for a new reality.</p><p>There are no known accounts of mortals traveling to Xoriat—at least, none who returned—so adventurers who do so are likely undertaking a historic journey. And in that journey, they may make a shocking discovery—though the daelkyr may be bound in Khyber, they are also still in Xoriat. Dyrrn the Corruptor, Valaara, Belashyrra—each dwells in a domain in Xoriat, attended by their servants and their armies. This ties to Xoriat’s uncanny relationship with time. The daelkyr may be in Xoriat because they haven’t left yet, or they might’ve already been released from their prisons and returned to Xoriat. Again, if time is a maze, the daelkyr stand above it looking down—but at the same time, they are also running in the maze. They can’t return to Eberron now, because they’re already there; but this may be why they seem unconcerned with their long imprisonment, because they’re also watching it all unfold from above. So adventurers could interact with any of the daelkyr in Xoriat, but fighting them there won’t impact their actions on Eberron. However, it could help adventurers learn about the weaknesses of the daelkyr, or perhaps obtain tools or weapons to use against them in the future.</p><h2>Aberrations</h2><p>The natural inhabitants of the plane are often so alien that mortals don’t even recognize them as living things. Most of the aberrations that people are familiar with on Eberron aren’t creations of Xoriat itself. Rather, the daelkyr, powers designed to interact with the Material Plane and its with mortals, created these aberrations as their servants, soldiers, and mementos of past conquests. In Eberron, most daelkyr have mixed forces; mind flayers could be found serving any of the great lords. In Xoriat, they’re more segregated; beholders dwell in the domain of Belashyrra, and mind flayers in the realm of Dyrrn.</p><p>What other terrors do the daelkyr have in Xoriat that they’ve never unleashed in Eberron? This depends in part on how many other realities the daelkyr have transformed; the mind flayers are relics of the destruction of the gith, just as the dolgrims and dolgaunts are souvenirs of the downfall of Dhakaan.</p><p>While aberrations created by the daelkyr are usually dangerous, there are also aberrations generated by the layers themselves. These planar creatures are alien and disturbing, but aren’t threatening unless provoked.</p><h2>Powers of the Void</h2><p>The daelkyr aren’t the most powerful forces in Xoriat. There are greater powers in the void, spirits so vast and alien that they can only be perceived by the ripples they create in reality. Both the Unseen Citadel and Belashyrra are ideas in the mind of something greater. Do these powers slumber? Do they consciously adjust the rules of their layers? Or are they simply ideas cast aside by the Progenitors, models of reality that were ultimately abandoned? If Xoriat is the realm of discarded concepts, this could be the drive behind the daelkyr’s endless quest to disfigure—or perfect—reality.</p><h1>Layers</h1><p>Xoriat is a void lacking not only matter, but also space and time, and a mortal creature that enters it effectively ceases to exist. But there are powers in this void, and the layers of Xoriat reflect their thoughts. Each of the daelkyr dwells in a layer, the place that spawned that daelkyr; this layer usually reflects the daelkyr in tone, and it can use its lair actions anywhere in its layer. However, not all of Xoriat’s layers can support mortal life; there’s a layer where intense gravity crushes any physical creature, and a layer where all matter is transformed into pure thought.</p><p>Adventurers need to find portals to move from layer to layer. Portals are unique based on the layer’s properties of each layer, and using a portal always has a price. Sometimes the price is paid in memories; the DM sets the emotional tone of the memory (joy, sorrow, anger), then each player describes the memory their character has lost. With other portals, the price may be knowledge, but this isn’t taken from the adventurers— rather, when they pass through the portal, they learn a secret they might have rather not known.</p><p>In exploring the layers of Xoriat, it’s important to highlight the fundamentally unnatural flavor of the plane.The layers of Xoriat contain revelations; these can be truths about the adventurers that they don’t want to know, or secrets about reality itself.</p><h2>The Unseen Citadel</h2><p>This is the stronghold and birthplace of the daelkyr Belashyrra. The Lord of Eyes imagined the beholders and brought that vision to life, and the Citadel is home to a host of beholderkin. Tiny floating eyes buzz about like insects. Millipede-like creatures have rows of eyes running down their backs. The true beholders are mostly focused in deep contemplation of specific things, and don’t pay attention to outsiders unless they’re disturbed. Some study strange paintings. Others watch scrying pools reflecting images of Eberron or other planes. And some examine seemingly mundane objects, such as a rusty iron key, a dead rabbit, or an expensive hat. However, there are a few that patrol the Citadel, watchful for intruders.</p><p>The surfaces of the Citadel are made from an iridescent material that your eyes can’t quite focus on, as if the walls and floor are blurred. There are mirrors spread around the halls. Some run slow and show you younger than they are; others show glimpses of the future. Scrying pools reveal secrets you don’t want to know—current events on Eberron, scenes from the past, or the possible future.</p><h2>The Fields of Thought</h2><p>This layer is the domain of Dyrrn the Corruptor. Purple fields are bathed in ultraviolet light, and fluorescent sculptures shed eerie dim light. Varr farmers dance as they tend the fields, but what they cultivate are emotions; anyone walking through a field feels a powerful emotion (fear, sorrow, anger, guilt) washing over them. Each field has an outpost containing an elder brain, with a bright line of thought transmitting the emotions to Dyrrn’s tower at the heart of the layer.</p><p>Dyrrn’s tower is made of glowing threads of pure thought intertwined around a massive steel spinal column. This tower is filled with the tools of fleshcrafting. There are pools of blood and canals of amniotic fluid, massive pulsing organs waiting for a purpose, and untended tendrils crawling across the floor. Adventurers might find a chamber that contains halfformed clones of the adventurers themselves . . . or perhaps the clones are completed, and consider the adventurers to be evil doppelgangers.</p><p>The spire amplifies Dyrrn’s telepathic abilities, letting it sense all living creatures within the layer. Dyrrn specializes in corruption, and it may challenge adventurers with mental projections, such as people plucked from their memories, who seek to turn them against their allies.</p><h2>Other Layers</h2><p>Every daelkyr has a home layer, but there are endless layers of Xoriat, each reflecting a discarded idea or a maddening truth. Consider the following examples.</p><h3>A House Built from Hate</h3><p>Each character sees the house’s form slightly differently, but they all feel the hate in the walls. Mirrors reflect images of things the viewer hates, and books in the house chronicle the hateful deeds committed by everyone the adventurers know—including each other. The longer the adventurers stay in the houses, the easier it becomes to hate each other . . . or themselves.</p><h3>Empty White Space </h3><p>There’s seemingly no end to this endless void of bleak solitude. To proceed, the characters must act out their travel—pretending to travel just as they pretend there is meaning in their lives. If they can keep up the charade, the world they imagine will take shape around them.</p><h3>A Lush Orchard</h3><p>The trees grow secrets, while more buzz around in the air like tiny birds. Some of them may be secrets of the adventurers, or those of their enemies. Others are secrets of strangers and secrets about reality. Do the adventurers block their ears, or do they try to listen?</p><h1>Xorian Stories</h1><p>The seals of the Gatekeepers make Xoriat one of the more difficult planes for adventurers to reach. However, a trip to Xoriat would be a revelatory adventure. Interactions with the denizens of Xoriat are largely limited to the cults of the Dragon Below and the servants of the daelkyr. However, there are a few ways the plane could spawn adventures.</p><h2>Planar Patron</h2><p>A warlock with a Great Old One patron could say that their patron isn’t simply a daelkyr; rather, it’s one of the Powers of the Void within Xoriat itself. Such contact is unprecedented—what is the nature of this connection? It may be that the Power doesn’t converse with the warlock, but rather downloads knowledge directly into its mind. A disturbing possibility is that the warlock isn’t supposed to be receiving this information; the knowledge stream could be intended for a powerful mind flayer, but the warlock has become linked to this psychic channel. This could provide information about the plans of the illithid’s cult, but can the warlock do anything about it?</p><h2>A Glimpse of the Future</h2><p>When the adventurers interfere with a ritual of a cult of the Dragon Below, they find themselves three years in the future . . . and something has gone terribly wrong. Perhaps the Mourning has spread and consumed Breland. Maybe the overlord Sul Khatesh has broken her bonds; under her rule, the warlock-knights of Aundair are conquering the Five Nations. The adventurers must find a way back to their own time—after they learn how to keep this future from coming to pass.</p><h2>Whispers in the Woods</h2><p>While the adventurers are in a Xorian manifest zone fighting a cult of the Dragon Below, one of the characters receives a revelation: Merrix d’Cannith will destroy the world in two years. Does it provide any additional information or just this one absolute fact? The character knows that this is the truth . . . but is this an actual glimpse of the future, or is it luring the character down a dark path?</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"knTUi1bTspduSmIG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.lWk1oRiNObLnKJA9"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1670041777252,"modifiedTime":1674934762095,"lastModifiedBy":"knTUi1bTspduSmIG"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"iJYPM6cJ45fqcbnX"}
{"name":"7 - The Organizations of Eberron","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"Adventuring Guilds","type":"text","_id":"rEvIMicbsgCvjZE7","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>Clifftop Adventurers' Guild</h1><blockquote><p>The Clifftop guild has a reputation as a collection of helpful and good-hearted adventurers. Members who tarnish the guild’s reputation can no longer take advantage of the guild’s benefits.</p></blockquote><p>Sharn’s Clifftop neighborhood, located in the upper part of the Dura district, has long served as a crossroads for adventurers and soldiers of fortune. A dwarf named Shekkal Korranor established the Clifftop Adventurers’ Guild 150 years ago, intending it as a place where explorers and wanderers could find support and good company. Shekkal died in the Last War, but the guild remains—a social club for adventurers and a one-stop marketplace for anyone seeking capable champions.</p><h2>Guildhall</h2><p>The Clifftop Adventurers’ Guild headquarters is the physical and social center of its district, a massive stone edifice built with the riches acquired over a lifetime of adventuring. Part quiet library, part comfortable inn, part active gymnasium, and part rowdy tavern, the guildhall contains practically every facility adventurers could need to train, study, and socialize. The neighborhood around it caters to adventurers’ other needs with its variety of shops and services.</p><h2>Membership</h2><p>Most of the members of the Clifftop Adventurers’ Guild have a modest amount of experience as successful adventurers. Nearly everyone can boast of a successful delve into the old ruins beneath Sharn or an expedition to the Talenta Plains. The guild’s leader, a dwarf named Sumara “Summer” Korranor, is a descendant of its founder and a fixture around the guildhall..</p><h2>Allies</h2><p>Relationships with most of the guild’s allies are based on business and built on upstanding reputations. Ultimately, though, the guild is a loose affiliation of groups, and organizations that have a good relationship with one of those groups might not transfer their good will to another. The following groups do brisk business with members of the Clifftop Adventurers’ Guild.</p><h3>Affiliated guilds</h3><p>Beyond Sharn, the guild has established good relations with adventuring guilds across Khorvaire, many of which have reciprocal agreements: their members can use the Clifftop facilities when they are in Sharn, and Clifftop guild members can make use of their facilities as well. Lists of these other guilds are kept in the Sharn guildhall.</p><h3>Clifftop businesses</h3><p>The guild is a prominent feature in its neighborhood, and much of the area is dedicated to meeting guild’s needs. Some businesses there offer small (5 percent) discounts to guild members, and all businesses are eager to avoid angering members of the guild lest they lose the business of other members.</p><h3>House Sivis</h3><p> A Speakers’ Guild enclave in Clifftop specializes in translating texts from Xen’drik. It also provides legal services for adventurers in trouble.</p><h3>House Tharashk</h3><p>The Tharashk enclave in Clifftop provides the services of guides with extensive experience exploring Xend’rik, and it is careful to retain only guides who receive positive referrals from guild members. House Tharashk also uses the guild as a means to hire adventurers to serve as bodyguards on their own prospecting expeditions.</p><h2>Enemies</h2><p>Individual adventuring groups readily make lasting enemies, and occasionally that animosity extends to the guild as a whole—as is the case with the following organizations:</p><h3>Deathsgate Explorers’ Club</h3><p>A fierce rivalry simmers between the Clifftop guild and Sharn’s other local adventurers’ guild. Sometimes the rivalry can be described as almost friendly, but the Deathsgate guild occasionally escalates it with vandalism of the Clifftop guildhall or even physical (but usually nonlethal) attacks on guild members in dark alleys.</p><h3>Sharn Watch</h3><p>Clifftop is protected of the Daggerwatch Garrison and Watch Commander Lian Halamar. Halamar has no love for adventurers and is happy to catch guild members on the wrong side of the law.</p><h1>Acquisitions Directorate</h1><p>XXX.</p><h1>Wayfinder Foundation</h1><p>XXX.</p><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Criminal Organizations","type":"text","_id":"TKc8GOdDsI7k12Xh","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>The Aurum</h1><blockquote><p>The Aurum, a shadowy alliance of some of the wealthiest citizens of Khorvaire, uses the power of gold and platinum to increase its influence across the continent. From its headquarters in Krona Peak in the Mror Holds, this organization believes that members of the Aurum must earn their place in the world, not simply stumble into it. It also keeps its true intentions highly secret. </p></blockquote><p>The Aurum was born in the Mror Holds. Even before the Last War and the dwarves’ declaration of independence, various members of the powerful clans had joined together in a secret fraternity designed to increase the wealth and power of its members. With the collapse of Galifar and the rise of the dwarf nation, the members of the Aurum began to look beyond the Ironroot Mountains. Guildmasters, crime lords, merchant princes, nobles, and members of dragonmarked houses, among others, joined the secret society, and slowly it became more than a simple fraternity. Between the influx of new blood and the devastation of the Last War came a rush of new ideas, which resulted in a new sense of purpose for the cabal.</p><h2>Structure</h2><p>The organization is divided into four levels, called concords—copper, silver, gold, and platinum. Higher rank provides a member with greater access to the resources of the Aurum and a greater voice in society meetings. Rank is based both on personal influence and services provided to the group. A powerful heir of a dragonmarked house joins the Gold Concord, while a minor guildmaster starts in the Copper Concord. In time, any member has the chance to advance to the Platinum Concord.</p><p>Aurum Concordians wear a plain ring on each finger—eight in all. Members of the Copper Concord wear copper rings, members of the Silver Concord wear silver rings, and so on. More a symbol of status than a precious bauble, each ring has the same value as 10 coins fashioned from the same kind of metal.</p><p>Most members believe that the Platinum Concord manages the affairs of the Aurum, for which Antus ir'Soldorak serves as chancellor, but persistent rumors hold that the true masterminds of the conspiracy form an inner circle known as the Shadow Cabinet. This so-called \"Shadow Cabinet\" is alleged to exist outside the structure of the concords and works to manipulate the nations of Khorvaire.</p><h2>Headquarters</h2><p>The Aurum maintains public offices in every capital of the Five Nations, and in most other large cities as well. These structures are plain and windowless, with only the Aurum’s sigil— a golden coin surrounded by a matching chain—to mark the building’s purpose. To the public eye these are private clubs where Concordians enjoy membership’s benefits.</p><p>Rising from the side of Krona Peak in the Mror Holds is the Golden Vault, the Aurum’s headquarters and the site where the organization was first founded. Unlike the Aurum’s other strongholds, the Golden Vault is ostentatious—a sprawling structure spacious enough to accommodate hundreds of members and luxurious enough to satisfy their every need. Gardens filled with priceless statuary, a museum with treasures from nearly every age, and libraries containing the collected works of the greatest thinkers make it a veritable palace of culture and refinement. For these reasons, the Vault has countless traps, sentries, and magical wards—the best security money can buy.</p><h2>Agenda</h2><p>It’s a social club, with a hall in every major city in the Five Nations. It’s a philanthropic organization that supports local communities and arts. It’s a place where people with different political and religious beliefs can set those differences aside and talk; according to Soldorak, many of the most important negotiations of the Last War took place around a golden table. But ultimately, at the end of the day, it’s an organization that exists to increase the wealth and power of its members. </p><p>The hidden ministers of the Shadow Cabinet, if such a thing truly exists, are said to believe that the aristocracy has no place running society. Kings and queens make excellent figureheads, but no individual noble has the wisdom required to rule efficiently. The Last War proves this assertion, and the leaders of the Aurum intend to see to it that any future wars serve their own interests. To this end, they have been recruiting agents throughout the nations and the dragonmarked houses, targeting ambitious people with some amount of power and influence. Or, you know, they would be, if such a thing actually existed</p><h1>The Boromar Clan</h1><blockquote><p>The Boromar Clan is the most powerful criminal organization in Sharn. From a humble start as a gang of smugglers and thieves, the Boromars have risen to become one of the most influential forces in the city.</p></blockquote><p>The Boromars have a stranglehold on the smuggling trade and own the majority of the gambling halls in the city. Most of the fences and thieves in Sharn either work directly for the Boromars or pay tribute in exchange for independence. They control a vast network of extortion, blackmail, and graft that extends from the slums of Lower Dura to the heights of Skyway, with its headquarters in the halfling district of Little Plains (in Middle Menthis). But their influence reaches far beyond the criminal underworld. The early Boromar patriarchs invested wisely over the centuries, and today the Boromars are one of the Sixty families of Sharn. The Boromar Clan owns many of the warehouses in Precarious and Cogsedge. It owns taverns and inns throughout the city, and has a considerable interest in the shipping trade. A Boromar heir sits on the city council of Sharn, and the current patriarch is a member of the Gold Concord of the Aurum.</p><h2>The Boromar Clan in Sharn</h2><p>While the Sharn Watch is well aware of the criminal enterprises of the Boromar Clan, the Watch rarely interferes with Boromar activities. The Boromars have been bribing Watch captains for generations, and this is largely taken for granted. Those councilors and Watch captains that have chosen to fight the Boromars have always suffered swift and mysterious deaths, and the lesson has not gone unheeded. In addition, if the Boromar Clan collapsed, the underworld would erupt in anarchy as dozens of petty crime lords fought for territory and position. As much as many of the councilors would like to see the Boromar Clan destroyed, it simply hasn’t been an option—until now.</p><p>Over the past two years, the Droaamite organization known as Daask has been launching raids against Boromar holdings. These attacks have been becoming bolder and more frequent with each passing month, and the monsters are also beginning to muscle in on many activities traditionally controlled by the Boromars. The Boromar Clan is hampered by its size; Daask is a mobile organization using guerilla tactics, and the Boromars can’t afford sufficient security to cover all of their operations. The Boromars have many enemies on the city council who are happy to see them cut down to size, and these opponents have prevented the resources of the Sharn Watch from being deployed against Daask.</p><p>The Boromar Clan is a massive organization, and it will not fall overnight. But for centuries, it has been resting on its reputation of omnipotence—and this reputation is quickly being shattered. Even if Daask were destroyed tomorrow, the long-term damage would still haunt the Boromars for years to come. Saidan Boromar needs to find a way to counter Daask, and he needs to do it soon. A group of mercenary adventurers might prove far more effective than the soldiers Saidan usually hires for muscle work—but does the party really want to help the Boromar Clan?</p><h2>Prominent Individuals</h2><p>The Boromar Clan employs people of all races, but the inner circle of the organization is comprised of halflings: 108 in all, including 32 members of the actual Boromar family.</p><ul><li>Saidan Boromar The current patriarch of the family, Saidan learned his trade on the streets of Lower Dura, and he has a quick tongue, silent feet, and a swift hand with a knife. Saidan and his wife Mala can usually be found at the Tain Gala.</li><li>Mala Boromar d’Jorasco An unmarked heir of House Jorasco, her marriage to Saidan has formed important ties between the crime lord and the healers of Sharn. Jorasco healers help Boromar halflings free of charge, with the expectation that Saidan will reimburse them for their efforts; this emergency assistance has saved the lives of many Boromars ambushed and left for dead by Daask brigands.</li><li>Councilor Ilyra Boromar The eldest daughter of Mala and Saidan. Her position on the city council has been invaluable in the past, but now her influence is slipping away.</li><li>Castar A diviner and the intelligence expert of the Boromar Clan and Saidan’s chief adviser. Saidan expects Castar to come up with a solution to the problem of Daask, and the gnome may find himself at the bottom of the Dagger River if he doesn’t come up with an idea soon.</li><li>Halak Boromar The family’s chief enforcer. The Boromar Clan still exists in the Talenta Plains, and Halak is a recent immigrant. As a result, he has more of a taste for blood than his city-bred kinfolk, and he likes nothing better than tracking and killing Daask goblins and gnolls. He is illiterate and not the brightest halfling at the best of times, but he is quick, strong, and surprisingly deadly. Halak commands the Clawfoots, the family’s personal guard; there are 15 Clawfoot warriors.</li></ul><p>Most of the 260 core members of the Boromar Clan are bookkeepers, administrators, or thieves. The Boromar Clan maintains a force of 30 burglars and cutpurses, but it specializes in intimidation, deception, smuggling, and similar trades. When it comes to physical violence, Saidan usually hires members of the Sharn Guard or employs the services of House Tarkanan. The Clawfoots are called in on rare occasions, but primarily defend the Boromar holdings in Little Plains.</p><h2>Benefits of Membership</h2><p>To join the Boromar Clan, an individual must be sponsored by a current member in good standing. A member of the Boromar family interviews the prospective member, probing to fi nd out what he has to offer the Boromars and what risks he may pose. Halflings generally have an easy time joining the Boromars; other individuals may have to serve a probationary period or perform a simple service on behalf of the Boromars to prove their talents.</p><p>The Boromar Clan has a great deal of political and economic power in Sharn. As a member of the Boromars, the character can get a 5% discount on any sort of goods or services he wishes to acquire, as long as he’s willing to use a vendor with ties to the Boromar Clan. Halfling members of the Boromars receive a 10% discount at Jorasco houses of healing.</p><p>The Boromar Clan has safe houses across the city, and a member can always find a safe place to sleep, even if it is a flophouse. Other advantages include the ability to fence goods at no cost, to take out loans at 10% interest/week, and to arrange burglaries for 15% of the standard cost. The character can expend a favor to have minor criminal charges dismissed; many members of the Sharn Watch are in the pay of the Boromar Clan, and are willing to overlook a minor offense. Finally, a favor can be used to request an audience with one of the city councilors with ties to the Boromars, although this does not carry any promise of assistance.</p><p>While membership in the Boromar Clan offers many advantages, the character earns the enmity of Daask, and the monsters will go out of their way to harm an up-and-coming Boromar agent. </p><h1>Daask</h1><blockquote><p>Daask is a criminal organization that has recently begun to spread across Breland and Aundair. Using violence and intimidation to carve out a niche in the underworld, the group is composed almost exclusively of monsters from Droaam. Rumors say that Sora Katra is the mastermind behind this group. In common, the name would translate to \"The Monster's Eye\".</p></blockquote><p>First appearing in Sharn in 988YK, they quickly spread to Wroat, Passage, Starilaskur, Ghalt, Lathleer and Fairhaven in the five years that followed, with Fairhaven being their most recent endeavor. In each city they operate only in the most lawless areas, and they are primarily engaged in protection rackets, loan sharking, and illicit alchemical substances. Their bases are renovated Dhakaani Empire subterranean strongholds, to which outsiders are almost never permitted access. Instead, each Daask cell has one location above ground where one of their spokespersons can be found. In Sharn, this is Shamukaar in Khyber's Gate, a tavern and butcher shop for Droaam refugees.</p><h2>Membership Composition</h2><p>Most of their members are Gnolls, Shifters and Orcs, with Ogres, Worgs, Minotaurs, Tieflings and Gargoyles making up the rest of their numbers. Harpies, War Trolls, Medusas, Lycanthropes and several kinds of trained feral monsters are available for special occasions, though the threat of their potential involvement alone has proven an effective intimidation tool in its own right. The exact composition of a Daask cell varies based upon the city; in Sharn, an unusually large amount of Harpies and Gargoyles are present. The leader of a Daask cell can be of any race, but they are always imposing individuals.</p><p>Notable Members:</p><ul><li>Ash, a human priest of the Shadow in Sharn.</li><li>Askhora, medusa and leader of the Daask cell in Wroat.</li><li>Cavallah, oni, expert at aerial combat and leader of the Daask cell in Sharn.</li><li>Cazha Bloodwing, who resides in Sharn.</li><li>Fell, werewolf and leader of the Daask cell in Passage.</li><li>Harash, a male medusa who is Cavallah's right hand.</li><li>Keshta, a gnoll leader of a unit of gnoll commandos in Sharn.</li><li>Zaeran, an elf werewolf visiting Sharn.</li></ul><h2>Criminal Activities</h2><p>The protection racket is what they are altogether best known for, and they make good on their promises surprisingly often. Most of the violence Daask commits targets other criminal groups, and as they operate only in the most lawless areas many have begun appreciating their fair but harsh justice.</p><p>As loan sharks, they offer the raw gold of Droaam's mines to those in need. To ensure swift repayment, they often demand collateral in the form of the \"stone loan\", where one of the borrower's family members is petrified by a Medusa. Failure to repay the debt by the due date results in a finger or toe being chipped from the statue and sent to the borrower for each missed payment. Unclaimed victims are often brought back to Droaam, where they are auctioned off to the highest bidder to make up for lost revenue.</p><p>The trade in illicit alchemical substances is where Daask butts heads with other criminal organizations the most, as they compete for the same markets. Aside from long-time junkie favorites such as dreamlily, Daask also offers one mysterious product no other organization does: Dragon's Blood, a highly addictive substance which enhances arcane magic. Several influential members of society have become addicted to this substance, and as Daask is the only organization which can supply it, this has become an additional level of influence for the group.</p><h2>Secret Purpose</h2><p>Anyone studying Daask for a prolonged time will notice that many of their actions show too much thought and foresight, some of their activities only hitting an enemy months after the fact, and sometimes in a different city altogether. The reason for this is that Daask is guided by one hand: that of Sora Katra.</p><p>Each cell leader owns a scying crystal that puts them in direct contact with Sora Katra whenever she wishes. She knows who owes Daask gold, she knows who uses Dragon's Blood, and she uses this knowledge to slowly but surely manipulate events across the east on a massive scale. Slowly but surely her agents are crippling the established criminal guilds, and once they are through with them Daask will have free reign in the east's seedy underbelly.</p><p>Daask is expert at manipulation, and there's no telling how many high-placing members of society are already under their control through the threat of violence (against them, or a petrified loved one) or the threat of being cut off from their Dragon's Blood supply forever.</p><p>Each member of Daask is an elite soldier, chosen more for intelligence than for anything else. The ogre enforcers may seem like brutes, but it is all a carefully constructed facade. When circumstances demand it a Daask cell pulls together with all the precision of a military strike team, and they have an immensely diverse set of monstrous abilities to pull from. With all the resources of Droaam behind them, their operatives are often armed with magic items, artifacts and oracular insight to boot.</p><p>Dragon's Blood: So far, Dragon's Blood has defied all analysis; somehow, one of the ingredients is known only to the Daughters of Sora Kell. It is unlikely to be actual dragon blood, and the exact effects vary by user and by dosage.</p><h1>House Tarkanan</h1><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Gov't, Military and Espionage","type":"text","_id":"4o3BIxAkzAxbcKSk","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>The Argentum</h1><blockquote><p>“My friends, the Eye of Daskar has apparently resurfaced and found its way into the private collection of a Cyran wizard named Arvik Rularin. You know what the Eye means to Thrane. I’ d like you to recover it. You leave for Newthrone tonight.” —Nystrum Shadar, Minister of the Argentum</p></blockquote><p>The Argentum is a ministry within the Church of the Silver Flame dedicated to the acquisition, study, and redistribution of magic items and artifacts. Freed from all restrictions and disavowed by the Church at large, it sends agents abroad to retrieve items of power—things that can be used by Thrane to solidify its political and magical dominance. Some of these items languish in half-forgotten ruins. Others must be snatched from the clutches of their present owners. The Argentum is a shadow organization that cares not for treaties. It exists because Thrane needs powerful magic as much as it needs great armies.</p><h2>Affiliation</h2><p>The Argentum is looking for loyal Thranes (or foreigners whose loyalty can somehow be assured) with a penchant for espionage. The nature of the Argentum’s work demands a broad range of expertise. It needs agents skilled in the use of arcane and divine magic. It also needs agents who can verify an item’s authenticity, gather information about an item’s whereabouts, negotiate, lie, steal, fight, and escape.</p><p>Agents typically operate in teams of four, with each member bringing a unique set of skills and abilities to the team. New agents are assigned relatively low-risk missions, such as stealing potions from an alchemist’s shop or scrolls from a library. Agents who complete their mission without drawing undue attention to the Argentum are rewarded for their good work and given more challenging missions. Missions rarely happen in quick succession, so the Argentum allows its agents to pursue their own goals between assignments (although agents cannot use the organization’s resources for unauthorized quests).</p><p>For the Argentum to hire you, you must be a Thrane citizen. The Argentum will also consider anyone recommended to them by at least two Thrane cardinals. The Minister of the Argentum has the authority to grant citizenship to any such candidate once he or she is indoctrinated into the organization, but that citizenship can be instantly revoked if the agent and the Argentum part company for any reason.</p><p>As an agents reputation within the Argentum improves, they will eventually be invited to join the inner circle, where they’ll have their pick of assignments as well as a heftier reward for delivering powerful items and artifacts into the Argentum’s clutches.</p><h2>The Argentum in the World</h2><p>The Argentum’s researchers rely on Thrane’s libraries, bards, and spy networks to gather intelligence on specific magic items. In some rare instances, they employ House Phiarlan or House Thuranni spies to help gather the information they require, although they call upon the servants of shadow houses only when the item they seek is particularly important or valuable.</p><p>If your players are tired of pillaging dungeons for no apparent reason or want more coin for their hard won magic items, the Argentum provides a new and interesting toy for them to play with. The structure of the Argentum allows the PCs to stick together as a group. After all, if they clearly work well together, the Argentum has little reason to split them up.</p><p>Minister Nystrum Shadar answers to the Council of Cardinals and manages the entire organization, which is based in Flamekeep. He also shares information with Queen Diani ir’Wynarn, possibly out of respect for her position or perhaps because he longs to see her returned to power. A retired army general, Minister Shadar is very “hands on” but trusts his troops to get the job done. Shadar has twenty-four directors who report to him. Each director manages a team of agents, couriers, spies, information gatherers, or researchers. Agents are split by color (black, white, and gray), as previously noted. Couriers, spies, and information gatherers are separated by nation and have false identification papers certifying them as citizens of the respective nations in which they operate. Research teams are divided up by magic item type (arms and armor, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, wondrous items, and artifacts). The hard-nosed Director of Artifact Research, Lycia Velencor, serves as Minister in Shadar’s absence.</p><p>At any given time, the Argentum has a dozen or more operations underway. Most of the missions take place outside of Thrane’s borders, from the Shadow Marches and Demon Wastes to Q’barra and the Lhazaar Principalities. The Argentum even has operatives in Stormreach, on the continent of Xen’drik.</p><p>Very few citizens of Thrane know of the Argentum, but they know Nystrum Shadar well enough as a retired army general who won several decisive victories toward the end of the Last War. Most assume that he’s living the quiet life these days—a thought that Shadar himself finds quite humorous.</p><p>The Argentum is known throughout the intelligence community. The Royal Eyes of Aundair have pegged several of its agents and shared this information with the King’s Dark Lanterns in Breland. Aundair, Breland, and Karrnath have their own counterparts to the Argentum, although only Aundair’s society of “relic hunters” has the size and scope to rival Thrane’s organization. Agents of the Argentum captured in Aundair, Breland, or Karrnath are treated harshly. Often the only way to escape imprisonment is to become a double or triple agent.</p><h1>The Dark Lanterns</h1><blockquote><p>“Your brother was a thief who sold secrets to Thrane. He betrayed the crown, so I killed him. That’s what happens to traitors.” —Aron “Sharpsword” Fainn, a King’s Dark Lantern</p></blockquote><p>The Dark Lanterns serve the crown of Breland as spies and assassins. Collectively they form the intelligence division of the King’s Citadel, a much larger organization sworn to defend Breland from its enemies and dispense justice in the name of King Boranel. More than any other division within the Citadel, the Dark Lanterns tend toward intelligence-gathering missions that extend beyond Breland’s borders. As the secret servants of the crown, members of the organization are granted the authority to conduct intelligence operations on foreign soil, execute covert missions across the globe, and prevent national secrets from falling into the hands of rival intelligence agencies. The Dark Lanterns also have an unwritten license to eliminate any creature that threatens their nation, its sovereign, or its citizens.</p><p>The King’s Dark Lanterns were vital to Breland’s defense during the Last War. However, conspiracies abound in the aftermath of war as nations struggle to rebuild and reclaim what was lost. The Thronehold Accords have done nothing to end the secret conflicts being waged across the Five Nations—conflicts steeped in espionage and subterfuge. With the threat of another war looming on the horizon, Breland needs its Dark Lanterns now more than ever.</p><h2>The Dark Lanterns in the World</h2><p>The King’s Dark Lanterns serve as Breland’s eyes and ears across Khorvaire and beyond. Through a vast network of contacts that includes local constabularies, the Dark Lanterns watch for known criminals entering Breland. They spy on radicals, politicians, foreign dignitaries, and resident exiles that represent a possible security risk to the people of Breland. The organization has upward of 500 agents operating within Breland’s borders and roughly one-fifth that number stationed abroad.</p><p>Dark Lanterns often work in teams. They also work closely with other divisions of the King’s Citadel, including the King’s Wands and the King’s Swords. In addition, some Dark Lanterns join forces with adventurers whose goals happen to coincide with theirs; in such cases, they might choose to keep their allegiance to the crown of Breland a secret.</p><p>A Dark Lantern operating within Breland’s borders can expect cooperation from any Brelish citizen in the pursuit of his mission. That said, a Dark Lantern represents the crown. One who takes advantage of a citizen’s cooperation or endangers the lives of innocent Brelish does not serve the crown and may have to answer for his misconduct.</p><p>A Dark Lantern doesn’t make a lot of money and is expected to live a modest life, so as not to attract undue attention. The work he is called upon to perform can be as simple and straightforward as spying on a foreign diplomat for a few days or as dangerous and complex as buying information from a dubious source in a remote city while dodging rival agents and assassins. When not performing a service for the crown, a Dark Lantern can participate in private ventures, provided they don’t conflict with his allegiance to the Brelish crown.</p><p>The King’s Dark Lanterns represent one branch of a greater organization called the King’s Citadel, which is based in Wroat. King Boranel’s brother, Lord Kor ir’Wynarn, commands the Citadel, assisted by five Citadel captains, each of whom heads up a division of the agency.</p><p>Captain Vron appoints various other captains to oversee the four branch offices of the King’s Dark Lanterns. The ruthless Captain Talleon Haliar Tonan tyrannically leads the King’s Dark Lanterns in Sharn and spends much of his time building useful relationships with the city’s criminal elements. The leader of the King’s Dark Lanterns in Starilaskur is Captain Meryl d’Ravalas, a handsome man with a disarming smile, a keen strategic mind, and a fondness for changelings. In Xandrar, leadership falls to Amber Korranor, the widow of a well-known dwarf adventurer (Shekkal Korranor) who died in the Last War. Amber has no military record, but she’s a proven Brelish patriot of sharp wit and mind. The fifth leader, Jev, leads a small team of agents in Stormreach on the continent of Xen’drik.</p><p>All King’s Dark Lanterns are based out of Wroat, Sharn, Starilaskur, Xandrar, or Stormreach and report to one of the five aforementioned division leaders.</p><h1>New Cyre</h1><blockquote><p>The terrible devastation that destroyed Cyre and created the Mournland left somewhere in the range of twenty thousand Cyrans without a home or a land to call their own. In the wake of the disaster, some Cyrans were away on business or for the war effort, while others were lucky enough to escape before the dead-gray mist that seemed to spread from the center of the nation grasped them in its cold embrace.</p></blockquote><p>Today, one of the largest concentrations of Cyran refugees can be found in eastern Breland, where, by the grace and good will of King Boranel, the town of New Cyre has been established. With a population of more than four thousand and growing, New Cyre has become a beacon for displaced Cyrans around the world. Oargev ir’Wynarn, last prince of Cyre, serves as mayor of the town and king-in-exile for his people.</p><p>Openly, Oargev praises the kindness of Breland and promises to be a good guest. Inwardly, three desires drive him. He wants to discover what really happened to his country. He wants to gain vengeance against those responsible. And he wants to rebuild his fallen nation, either in its original location or somewhere else if necessary. He has made an oath on the Mournland, his once-beautiful home that is now the grave of his ancestors, to make all three of these desires a reality.</p><p>Lately, Prince Oargev has decided on a new course of action. He plans to rebuild his nation in eastern Breland, deciding that he will claim all the land east of Dragon’s Crown when the time is right and the majority of the Cyran refugees have found their way to his side. The Brelish Parliament, not sure it wants twenty thousand refugees gathered within the country’s borders, has introduced legislation to limit the number of Cyrans that can settle in New Cyre. Oargev has opposed this legislation, and the decree is currently held up in debate and waiting for a vote. The king-in-exile has no intention of adhering to the decree even if it passes the vote and becomes law. “These Brelish laws are fit for the Brelish,” Oargev has told his closest aides, “but they have no authority over the sons and daughters of Cyre.”</p><h1>The Order of Rekkenmark</h1><blockquote><p>“With this sword, I will defend Karrnath to the last. Its shine is my shine, for I will be a fl ash of glory for Karrnath. Its sharpness is my sharpness, for I will outwit any who oppose me. Its steel is my steel, for I will neither bend nor break in my duties.” —Part of the “Oath of the Sword” administered to Rekkenmark’s advanced graduates</p></blockquote><p>For almost a thousand years, the best military officers in Galifar graduated from Karrnath’s Rekkenmark Academy and joined the Order of Rekkenmark. During the Last War, members of the Order led Karrnath’s armies to victory time and again, often against daunting odds. Even in a time of peace, the opal ring that marks a member of the Order earns more respect from veteran soldiers than a dozen medals.</p><p>The vast majority of warlords and officers in the various Karrnathi armies graduated with honors from the Rekkenmark Academy and earned a place in the Order of Rekkenmark. However, both King Kaius and the Karrnathi warlords sometimes bestow membership in the Order on those who excel on the battlefield or in other service to Karrnath. Joining the order in such a way is not unlike earning an honorary degree from a university or a battlefield commission. It’s a recognition of skills and accomplishments equivalent to those who did excel at the academy.</p><h2>The Order of Rekkenmark in the World</h2><p>Most members of the Order of Rekkenmark treat it as simply an honorary society. They travel to Rekkenmark once a year for the annual meeting, raise a toast to their fellows, and wear their opal ring with pride.</p><p>Inner circle members see a different side of the order, however. For them, the order is a useful way to accomplish military matters without involving the entire military chain of command. For example, one member of the order can say to another, “Let’s try integrating your light cavalry with my scouts, then probe into Valenar,” without involving the entire Karrathi army bureaucracy. The Order of Rekkenmark is, in some ways, a parallel leadership structure based not on rank but on the shared experience of getting through Rekkenmark Academy.</p><p>And for a few dozen elite members of the order, the High Councilors, the order is an important sounding board for King Kaius as he contemplates military matters. Whenever word of a military crisis reaches the king’s ears, he summons High Councilors to seek their expertise before making a decision. The councilors aren’t Kaius’s sole advisors, and he doesn’t always heed their advice, but they are among the most influential voices in his court.</p><p>At the head of the High Councilors is Gruden ir’Erdei, Kaius’s First Warlord. Ir’Erdei is an honors graduate of the Rekkenmark Academy, its former chancellor, and Karrnath’s Southern Front general at the end of the Last War. Like many in the Karrnath military, Gruden is dubious of Kaius’s push for peace and expects war to reignite, perhaps within a matter of months.</p><p>The most famous member of the Order of Rekkenmark is Caldrus ir’Kurtvach. Known throughout Karrnath as the “Rock of Herrenhold” from the battle there in 991 YK, Caldrus has retired from active duty and teaches a seminar on the Analects of War at Rekkenmark Academy every semester. Caldrus chooses the staff officer and retinue for each member of the Inner Circle.</p><p>The Order of Rekkenmark also has a secret society within it: At All Costs. This small cabal of warlords thinks that ending the Last War was a mistake made by a foolish King Kaius. They undermine the authority of the crown whenever they can do so without getting caught, dragging their heels on the shift from a wartime army to a peacetime one. Members of the At All Costs society regard themselves as Karrnathi patriots through and through—it’s the king who won’t protect his country, they think. At All Costs leaders are particularly keen to influence other members of the royal family. Eventually, they feel, a more suitable king might emerge. And if At All Costs can “facilitate” the transition of power, so much the better.</p><p>Almost everyone in the Karrnathi military knows what the opal ring means: that the wearer is a well-trained, elite military leader. Accordingly, Karrn soldiers have an initial attitude of friendly toward members of the Order of Rekkenmark—so long as they’re attending to military matters. The order is well known among military commanders of other nations, as well. Officers who have the rank of major or higher probably know what the order means, and they’ll have an initial attitude of unfriendly based on a sense of rivalry or envy.</p><h1>Royal Eyes of Aundair</h1><blockquote><p>“The queen must know everything about her rivals if Aundair is to remain free. Whether in Fairhaven, a foreign capital, or the deepest wilderness, Aurala’s eyes must be everywhere.” —Thuel Racannoch, Spy Master of the Royal Eyes</p></blockquote><p>The Royal Eyes of Aundair serves as the crown’s elite covert force. Its operatives spy on other nations, pursue Aundair’s most notorious criminals, and undertake all sorts of cloak-and-dagger missions for Queen Aurala. The history of the Royal Eyes goes back to Lady Aundair herself, who had a handful of loyal agents she used to gather intelligence throughout the kingdom—and to watch the activities of her younger siblings.</p><h2>Affiliation</h2><p>Being a member of the Royal Eyes means simultaneously keeping track of what you’re doing and what you’re supposed to look like you’re doing. You’ve got to balance your actual identity as a spy for Aundair with your cover identity. And if you undertake freelance missions, that’s a third set of priorities to juggle.</p><p>Once you’ve reached the upper echelons of the Royal Eyes, you’ve proved both your effectiveness and your loyalty. That means either that you’re an Aundairian patriot or that a more personal code of honor motivates you to risk your life for queen and crown. The Royal Eyes pays well, but so do Aundair’s rivals, so most mercenary spies don’t join the Royal Eyes. They might get occasional missions from the Royal Eyes, but they’re never invited to join.</p><p>Most of your contact with the Royal Eyes is with your superior. When you first join the Royal Eyes, your superior will be another agent. But as you advance through the Royal Eyes’ hierarchy, you’ll report to assistant spy masters and eventually to Spy Master Racannoch and Queen Aurala directly. Your superior provides you with reports, gives you missions, and makes sure you get paid. Your job is to give your superior what the Royal Eyes call the “deliverables.” The deliverables are the tangible object of your mission: the item you were sent to steal, the crumbled stone of the bridge you destroyed, or the head of the rival spymaster. Sometimes the deliverables are information of a specific nature. Once you exchange the deliverables for your pay, your time is your own until the Royal Eyes needs your talents again.</p><p>The Royal Eyes is one of Queen Aurala’s favorite tools. In postwar Khorvaire, it is the queen’s primary instrument for influencing events beyond Aundair’s borders. About half your missions probably take place in foreign lands, and even those within Aundair often involve foreign agents or plots to destabilize Aundair or the crown.</p><p>Depending on your talents, your superiors may have you spy, fight, or commit acts of sabotage on the crown’s behalf—or perhaps all three in a particularly difficult mission. One month you might be on the trail of Rhunadask and the Eldeen Wolves, and the next might find you infiltrating a masquerade ball in Zilargo. All of your missions somehow relate to the queen’s ambitions—even if you can’t always see how the queen is involved.</p><h2>The Royal Eyes in the World</h2><p>The Royal Eyes works from shadows across Khorvaire. Of all the Five Nations’ covert agencies, the Royal Eyes is the most active. And with the exception of Houses Phiarlan and Thuranni, the Royal Eyes integrates magic into its spying efforts better than anyone. </p><p>Spy Master Thuel Racannoch manages the network and keeps track of Aundair’s many agents. He’s utterly loyal to Queen Aurala; her every word is an order to him. While his loyalty is beyond question, he’s cautious when he’s unsure of the queen’s wishes. Some of the assistant spy masters would like the Royal Eyes to do more on their own initiative and less at the behest of the queen. Thuel has a curt reply for his subordinates: “They call it the Royal Eyes for a reason.”</p><p>Queen Aurala appointed Racannoch to head the Royal Eyes immediately after the conclusion of the Last War. The previous minister, Nara ir’Galanatyr, was regarded as one of the queen’s closest wartime councilors, so her replacement puzzled court watchers. Ir’Galanatyr now lives in seclusion in Wyr. She hasn’t appeared in public since Queen Aurala signed the Treaty of Thronehold.</p><p>At any given time, the Royal Eyes has a dozen major operations under way. About half to two-thirds of these missions take place beyond Aundair’s borders. The remainder of the missions concern Aundair’s internal security. The Royal Eyes keeps dissidents under surveillance, chases spies from Thrane and Karrnath, and makes periodic raids against hostile targets in the Eldeen Reaches.</p><p>Most residents of Aundair have never heard of the Royal Eyes. It is a secret organization, and it likes to remain that way. There is a saying at court: “The Royal Eyes are watching.” But few truly understand the significance or truth of that statement. Only the most well-connected and powerful nobles have an understanding of what goes on within the alabaster tower that rises quietly about the Royal Court.</p><p>Beyond Aundair’s borders, the Royal Eyes are also an unknown or perhaps a rumor. Other intelligence agencies know of the Royal Eyes, of course, but since they tend to keep their own activities secret, little details of the games of intrigue get out into the public.</p><h1>Heirs of Dhakaan</h1><p>Coming Soon</p><h1>The Trust</h1><p>Coming Soon</p><h1>Wardens of the Wood</h1><p>Coming Soon</p><h1>The Znir Pact</h1><p>Coming Soon</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":700000,"name":"Newspapers and Universities","type":"text","_id":"hNrWuP4a6ACloajy","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>The Arcane Congress</h1><blockquote><p>As you soar upward, you see four castles, each floating on a rocky island thousands of feet above the verdant fields of Aundair. Each castle is a crazy-quilt of different architectural styles, each more outlandish than the last. Periodic flashes of light illuminate the windows, and every so often a gout of flame or eldritch energy bursts forth from a door or chimney.</p></blockquote><p>The Arcane Congress, one of Khorvaire’s greatest collections of arcane minds, operates out of the floating towers that hover above the village of Arcanix. Over the centuries, the Arcane Congress has turned its Aundair headquarters into a showcase for the power of magic. Visiting the floating towers means seeing wonders undreamt of by most Aundairians—from baffling illusions to animated contrivances to captured creatures from other dimensions.</p><p>The floating towers are at once a college of wizardry and the personal laboratories of some of the most powerful wizards in the Five Nations. Many a would-be magewright or wizard comes to the village of Arcanix, below the towers, hoping to study hard and someday ascend to the lofty ranks of Aundair’s finest arcanists.</p><p>The Arcane Congress devotes two of the towers, Glarehold and Amberwall, to training the next generation of magewrights and wizards. Nocturnas and Skyreach, the other two towers, are the residences, libraries, and laboratories of Arcane Congress members. From these two towers the Congress advises the Aundairian crown on magical matters and schemes against its rivals, the Twelve.</p><p>Everburning torches light every corner of the floating towers, unless a member of the Congress has a specific reason to prefer darkness. Some everburning torches burst into flame only when someone enters the room, dousing themselves instantly when the room is vacant. Others burn with strangely colored flame, adding a reddish or bluish tint to everything they illuminate. The floating towers are a quiet place; distracting noise is conducive to neither study nor political machinations. The temperature is always mild within the floating towers, no matter what is happening outside.</p><p>The Arcane Congress built the floating towers over eight hundred years, so their walls have known many architects, both mundane and magical. Within the floating towers, there’s always a strong aura of transmutation (the spells that keep the towers aloft) and at least one other aura.</p><h2>Arcanix</h2><p>This village of 800 people lies directly beneath the floating towers. The residents of Arcanix owe their livelihoods to the Arcane Congress, from the innkeeper who boards the parents of would-be wizards during the Autumn Entrance Examinations to the stablemaster responsible for exercising the steeds—both mundane and exotic—of some Arcane Congress spellcasters.</p><p>Most of the important wizards and sorcerers of the Arcane Congress live in the floating towers themselves, but a few reside in Arcanix. Raulo ir’Trannick, for example, is the lord mayor of Arcanix and a member of the Arcane Congress. His family has long had holdings on the southeastern banks of Lake Galifar, and his position as Trannick patriarch demands he live earthbound and board a hippogriff when he’s needed for the business of the Congress. Raulo and other members of the Trannick family are the proctors of the Autumn Entrance Exams, determining which of Aundair’s brightest will get a chance to become magewrights and wizards. Raulo also serves as a de facto ambassador between the Arcane Congress and any wizards who arrive at Ar can ix unannounced.</p><p>The Trannick family offers trained hippogriffs that can ascend to the floating towers for visitors unable to get there under their own power. The Trannicks collect a 25 sp per person transit fee, which they use to fund scholarships for deserving young mages.</p><p>Arcanix is also home to the Tower of Alchemy, one of the Five Nations’ premier colleges for the alchemical arts. Its senior mentor, Tzandro Kavalant, has created the alchemical golems that act as servants and guardians within the floating towers. Arcanix’s unique position makes it one of the Five Nations’ most magically aware places. Many of the residents are downright blasé about powerful arcane magic, while others take great delight in the astonishment on visitors’ faces when a carpet of flying alights on the town square or an aged wizard turns into a glorious dragon and flies away..</p><h2>The White Arch</h2><p>Visitors to the floating towers often ascend (via magic or the Trannicks’ hippogriffs) to Glarehold Tower, where an outcropping of rock has a massive white marble arch that leads to a white marble courtyard. The White Arch is also the traditional gateway that new students use when they begin their studies; many an Aundairian youth dreams of walking under the white arch, clad in the brown robes of a first-year student. The courtyard beyond the White Arch is the largest outdoor space on any of the four floating towers. Magically animated topiaries in the shape of boars stand at the corners of the courtyard</p><h2>Library of Robideur</h2><p>Near the top of Skyreach is one of Khorvaire’s finest collections of arcane lore—although librarians in Korranberg would argue the point. The library takes up the top four floors of Skyreach’s tallest spire, with bookshelves running from floor to ceiling. Only the doors and the stained-glass windows interrupt the walls crammed with spellbooks, tomes, and grimoires. A unique spell not unlike unseen servant controls the books within the library. An arcanist of the Arcane Congress need only state the title and author of a book, and it slides from its shelf, opens wide, then slowly descends to the arcanist’s waiting hands, lazily flapping its cover open and shut in imitation of a bird.</p><p>The half-elf sorcerer Robideur died more than 450 years ago, but his descendant Tanila is the head librarian. The library forbids checking out books even to the most powerful members of the Arcane Congress; examination of a book at one of the library’s oak desks is the only option. Tanila has an initial attitude of unfriendly toward anyone who even asks about checking out a book, and she won’t bend the rules unless her attitude is improved to helpful.</p><h2>Adal's Demesne</h2><p>At the center of Nocturnas are a series of chambers that Adal ir’Wynarn, Royal Minister of Magic and brother to Queen Aurala, calls home. Adal splits his time between the floating towers and his palace at Fairhaven. He regards the floating towers as a place where he can be free of court intrigues and free to direct his staff as they conduct magical research and build weapons of arcane destruction to defend Aundair or extend its reach.</p><p>Adal is more politically connected than most of the Arcane Congress. He has the queen’s ear at a moment’s notice (although the trust between them is far from complete). Adal isn’t a great wizard in his own right, but he’s a consummate power broker and charismatic leader. Most of the researchers on his staff are higher-level wizards than he is, and the many agents in Adal’s employ are likewise among the most elite in Aundair.</p><p>At any one given time, Adal has three or four major research or weapon-development programs under way within his chambers. Each is kept separate from the others, and only Adal knows the extent and progress of all the programs. One team might be trying to reverse-engineer House Cannith’s creation pattern for warforged. Another team works on a system of weather control, and a third is breeding wyverns that shoot fiery rays from their tails.</p><h2>Maze of Shadowy Terror</h2><p>In the lowest level of Amberwall Tower is a maze intended to humble young apprentices confident of their ability to meet any threat with magic. The Maze of Shadowy Terror spontaneously generates monsters from the summon monster spell lists with a shadow conjuration effect. The Amberwall instructors intended that the maze, which looks like a typical set of twisting dungeon corridors, serve as a final test for wizards and sorcerers before they head out into the world or become members of the Arcane Congress. But brave and foolhardy students eager to prove themselves are always sneaking into the basement and entering the maze on their own.</p><h2>Gate of Xabra</h2><p>Near the top of Nocturnas is an astronomical observatory and one of the great artifacts of the Arcane Congress: the Gate of Xabra. This circle of menhirs, transplanted from a Q’barran ruin shortly before the start of the Last War, has graven glyphs that correspond to no known language or code. The glyphs hold overwhelmingly powerful conjuration magic sufficient to send everything within the circle to another plane of existence.</p><p>When a would-be traveler uses a finger to trace certain glyphs on the stones, they glow slightly. When all the correct glyphs are lit, everything within the Gate of Xabra disappears and a whoosh of air fills the void that remains.</p><p>Finding the correct sequence of glyphs is no easy task. Fortunately, failed attempts don’t have negative consequences—or at least they haven’t so far. The glyph sequence can’t be learned by rote, because the correct glyph sequence depends on both the destination plane and the alignment of the stars around Eberron.</p><p>Uli Blackthatch studies the Gate of Xabra for the Arcane Congress. He has an extensive knowledge of the planes of Eberron and will direct planar travelers in what he believes is the correct sequence. The Gate of Xabra only opens for an instant, although in most cases it leaves a circular impression on the other plane that allows a return trip.</p><p>Travelers appear within the circle at the moment they arrive; once they step back inside it, they reappear in the gate chamber in Nocturnas. On the plane of Irian, the return circle might be marked with crystals, while it might be a circular glade on the forest plane of Lamannia. </p><h2>The Mosaic Committee</h2><p>From their floating castles above the village of Arcanix, the powerful spellcasters of the Arcane Congress delve into the greatest secrets of magic. The studies of one group of Congress wizards have led them to believe that the Draconic Prophecy, when fulfilled, will lead to cataclysmic destruction, not transformation. The only way to avert the future cataclysm, these wizards believe, is to destroy parts of the Prophecy as they are discovered—or better yet, prevent them from being revealed in the first place. This is the purpose for which the Mosaic Committee was formed.</p><p>The Mosaic Committee, named for the decoration in its secret meeting chamber, realizes that its mission puts it at odds with most of the world’s dragons, as well as the rest of the Arcane Congress. But most members of the Mosaic Committee are powerful wizards totally dedicated to their cause; they genuinely believe that they’re forestalling the end of the world. The stuffed dragon heads mounted on the walls of the Mosaic Chamber bear silent witness to the committee’s power and effectiveness.</p><h1>The Korranberg Chronicle</h1><p>Coming Soon.</p><h1>The Library of Korranberg</h1><p>Coming Soon.</p><h1>Morgrave University</h1><p>Coming Soon.</p><h1>The Sharn Inquisitive</h1><p>Coming Soon.</p><h1>The University of Wynarn</h1><p>Coming Soon</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":800000,"name":"Shadow Operators","type":"text","_id":"OfP2VqU0IC9hhnGM","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>The Gatekeepers</h1><blockquote><p>The Gatekeepers were the original druidic tradition on Khorvaire. Over fifteen thousand years ago, the green dragon Vvaraak came to the Shadow Marches and gathered followers around her. She had foreseen a cataclysm that only the younger races would be able to avert, and so she taught the orcs how to work with earth and wood, and how to read the future in the movements of the Ring of Siberys. She charged her students to watch for the signs of the great disaster, and always seek to preserve the balance of nature against those forces that would corrupt it.</p></blockquote><p>It was over seven thousand years before the Gatekeepers faced the first real threat to Khorvaire: the coming of the daelkyr. Leading armies of illithids, beholders, and other aberrations, these fiends sought to remake Khorvaire. The war that followed shattered the great Dhaakani empire of the Goblinoids, which spanned all of Khorvaire, and left terrible scars across the continent, but Kharaak’s students ultimately prevailed—the gates to Xoriat were sealed, and the daelkyr who remained were driven into the depths of Khyber.</p><p>The Gatekeepers were crippled by the war against the daelkyr. The survivors retreated to the depths of the Shadow Marches and the Eldeen Reaches. Gatekeeper barbarians and rangers hunted down the surviving aberrations, while the druids watched the skies for signs of new dangers. Eventually, humans came to Khorvaire. The few Gatekeepers that still stood guard against the abberant threat remained in the shadows. However, the circle did share their secrets with a few of the newcomers, and some humans  (and other beings) joined the ancient cause.</p><h2>Gatekeepers in the World</h2><p>Today, the Shadow Marches, and to a much lesser extent, the Eldeen Reaches, are steeped in the traditions of the Gatekeepers. What this means, in practice, is that followers of \"The Old Ways\", as it is generally called today, observe the traditional holidays, songs and oaths of the Gatekeepers, though almost none  are members of the actual organization itself. For instance, the typical follower of The Old Ways knows that you blindfold the dead so Belashyrra can’t use their eyes… but he doesn’t necessarily believe it literally. </p><p>Meanwhile, true Gatekeepers—the ones who are deeply concerned with maintaining the seals, who dispatch rangers into the deep swamps to fight Dolgaunts, etc—are essentially a secret society. They are sort of like a cross between a modern-day Revelations cult and the Men in Black. The majority of Marchers think that they’re a little over the top and creepy (if they even realize any particular individual is an actual Gatekeeper) … while the true Keepers, in turn, don’t bother the common people with the fact that they just eliminated a force of Dolgrims under Zarash’ak because, frankly, they don’t need to know. The fact that people know the Old Ways mean they can operate in the open; it’s just that people don’t realize that the local druidic holy man really IS a Gatekeeper with significant powers and not just an old storyteller.</p><h2>Vvaraak's Betrayal</h2><p>Throughout time, rogue dragons have pursued their own agendas and dreams. Still, in the aftermath of Aureon’s Folly and the destruction of Xen’drik, few dared to share the secrets of Argonnessen with lesser creatures. One such rebel was the Emerald Claw, father of Erandis Vol, and it destroyed him. A more well-regarded rogue was Vvaraak, the black dragon who trained the first Gatekeepers, and brought the secrets of druidic magic to Khorvaire. A true child of Eberron, Vvaraak foresaw a disaster that would wound the world itself. The Conclave had no interest in this struggle; just as the dragons had stood aside while the giants of Xen’drik battled Dal Quor, the elders of the Conclave told Vvaraak that they would act when a clear threat to Argonnessen existed, and not before.</p><p>Frustrated, Vvaraak abandoned her elders and her flight, traveled across the world, and began training humanoids and other creatures in the use of natural magic. Although she is best known for teaching the orcs of the west coast of Khorvaire, Vvaraak had other students. Some Seren druids attribute their skill to the teachings of the Ebon Mother, and lizardfolk boast Gatekeepers in Q’barra and Xen’drik. Vvaraak stayed in the Shadow Marches for less than a century, and her final fate is unknown. Perhaps she lived out her final days in humanoid form, moving among her students and hiding from the angry Eyes of Chronepsis. Perhaps she descended into Khyber to teach the derro and other denizens of the deep. Some say that she returned to Argonnessen, that her act of rebellion was actually a carefully calculated move on behalf of the Conclave. If so, it could be that the dragons subtly planned and implemented both the destruction of the Dhakaani Empire and the defeat of the daelkyr.</p><p>Of course, it’s possible that the Xoriat incursion was not the threat Vvaraak foresaw. If this is the case, what monumental danger still lies ahead?</p><h2>The Seals of the Gatekeepers</h2><p>The Gatekeeper seals are one of the great mysteries of Khorvaire. It’s well-established in legend that the Gatekeepers created the seals that hold Xoriat at bay and prevent the Daelkyr from returning to the surface. But what are the seals? Listen to a dozen stories and you’ll hear a dozen different answers.</p><ul><li>Some say they are dolmen structures found in the deep swamps, massive rune-carved stones infused with byeshk ore and placed in powerful manifest zones.</li><li>In other stories they are small disks worn as pendants by the Gatekeepers. Each pendant is connected to a particular Daelkyr, and the bearer can sense the thoughts of the Daelkyr and draw on its power… though this carries the threat of madness.</li><li>One story says that the mightiest druids turned themselves into trees, and that these guardian trees are themselves the seals.</li><li>One song popular in the Marches even claims that it is the seal, and that as long as it is sung the Daelkyr while never return.</li><li>Others believe that the seals are the light held in the dragonshards scattered throughout the Marches, and fear that House Tharashk’s mining of the shards will doom all.</li></ul><p>All stories agree that powerful magic was used to hide the seals, and that much is clear as divination magic has proven entirely unable to reveal any sort of useful information about the seals; whatever form they take, they won’t be easily found.</p><h1>The Ghaash’kala</h1><blockquote><p>In the dawn of time the world belonged to the fiends. The Binding Flame was born from a desperate act of sacrifice. The Overlords cannot be destroyed, merely held at bay; their power yearns to break free from the Flame that binds them, and their servants prey upon those who have inherited the world. The Flame is fueled by courage, and it is only through the vigilance and sacrifice of champions that the light remains strong enough to hold the darkness at bay.</p></blockquote><p>The prisons of the Overlords are scattered across the world, but their power is strongest in the Demon Wastes. Here lies the ruins of Ashtakala, the greatest city of the Age of Demons. Though the Overlords are bound, their power corrupts nature and weak minds. The Wastes are filled with horrors, both mortal and immortal. Left unchecked, these terrors would spread to the south and bathe Khorvaire in blood. But ancient magic and geography have established a barrier: the mountain range known as the Labyrinth. This barrier can’t stop the powerful rakshasa from leaving the Wastes, but it serves as a funnel for the lesser horrors.</p><h2>Ghaash'kala in the World</h2><p>Bloodthirsty barbarians, minor fiends, twisted creatures… all flow through the Labyrinth seeking release. One force guards the gates of the Labyrinth and protects the innocents to the south: The Ghost Guardians, the Ghaash’kala, sworn to serve the Binding Flame from birth to death and beyond. The life of a Ghost Guardian is one of endless strife. It is a mirror to the Flame itself: it is a battle than can never be truly won, but through sacrifice they can continue to contain the evil and protect the innocent from harm.</p><p>The Ghaash’kala have no written records and don’t know exactly how long their ancestors have fought against the darkness. It’s clear that couatl trained and equipped the first Ghaash’kala long before humanity came to Khorvaire. As such, the Ghaash’kala may be the first humanoids to channel the power of the Silver Flame… or as they call it, Kalok Shash, the Binding Flame.</p><h2>Structure</h2><p>There are four Ghaash’kala clans spread across the Labyrinth. As far as they are concerned, the world is divided into two sides: the living and the fel (a word that could be translated both as “unliving” or “unnatural”; it is a term that encompasses both undead, fiends and life that has been corrupted). They have no interest in politics or commerce; should the Overlords rise, they will care nothing for trivialities of mortal nations. The Ghaash’kala place most people into the category of “The weak innocents we are protecting,” but they will accept members of any race into their ranks. They feel disdain for anyone strong enough to fight who ignores the greater duty, especially mercenaries who squander their gifts without any conviction whatsoever.</p><p>The Kalok Shash is a simple faith, and the Ghaash’kala don’t waste time on the elaborate rituals or titles of the Church of the Silver Flame. There are only a few recognized positions among the faithful.</p><ul><li>A korta (“Speaker”) is someone who hears the Voice of the Flame more clearly than others. The korta serve as spiritual guides, diplomats and healers, using their connection to the Flame to guide and advise others. A korta’sha is a divine spellcaster. The korta’sha are always on the front lines, leading war parties and battling demonic influences.</li><li>A kala (“Guardian”) is a warrior who fights in service to the Flame; this includes the bulk of the Ghaash’kala population. A kala’sha is a divine warrior – typically a paladin.</li><li>A drok (“Hand”) is a non-combatant, either because of infirmity or because of a vital non-combat skill needed to support the fight.</li></ul><p>There are no equivalent ranks to bishop, priest, cardinal, or any of that. The Ghaash’kala are few enough in number that the korta and kala are distinguished by their deeds. Everyone knows that the korta’sha Hurok is the greatest of the Speakers; he doesn’t need some special title to indicate that. The Ghaash’kala are also considerably more blase about divine spellcasters than most human cultures. To the Ghaash’kala, these individuals are weapons. A korta’sha isn’t necessarily holier than a non-casting korta… but she has a purpose and a duty. She is a tank, and a tank belongs on the battlefield. While Ghaash’kala despise mercenary soldiers, they are truly baffled by the idea of divine spellcasters who do not use their powers to directly fight evil.</p><p>One might ask, how have the Ghaash’kala survived in the Demon Wastes for tens of thousands of years? Where do they get the supplies they need, from steel for their weapons to the food and water they need to survive? What are their shelters like?</p><p>Each of the four clans has a stronghold carved deep into the rock of the Labyrinth, each drawing on the powers of a manifest zone. These were created by dragons and couatl in the first age, and are imbued with powerful magic; it is these fortifications that have served as a final refuge in even the hardest times. Likewise, the Ghaash’kala possess tools and weapons that have been handed down for generations. The Ghaash’kala consider these relics to be sacred gifts, and they might as well be; the most potent of them were crafted by the beings who first kindled the Flame itself. Of course, an artifact is not something to be used lightly; sometimes generations pass before someone successfully bonds with a relic. Some say that Tira Miron’s blade Kloijner came from the Wastes, that the couatl guided her north to claim the weapon she needed to face Bel Shalor.</p><p>Such tools certainly help explain the survival of the Ghaash’kala. But there are only a few such artifacts. The Maruk stronghold has a well that never runs dry, a variation of the Alchemy Jug. But they still need food and any number of basic supplies that can’t be found in this poisoned land. But the very thing that makes the Wastes so dangerous also provides opportunity. The Demon Wastes are peppered with passages to Khyber… not simply the physical underworld, but a host of demiplanes and demonic realms. Fiends emerge from these paths to prey on the weak… and the Ghaash’kala venture into them to find what they need. The Maruk hunt balewolves in the Abyssal Forests of Khar, and wield weapons taken from the corpses of the demon foot soldiers of the Ironlands. These strange realms are alien and deadly, but over the many centuries the Ghaash’kala have learned their secrets. As a result, the Ghaash’kala have resources that can’t be found anywhere in Khorvaire. Their weapons are forged from unknown materials, and they brew salves and unguents that would make Jorasco weep. So the idea is that the Ghaal’dar are essentially barbarians living in an apocalyptic landscape – but by mastering that environment, making the most of the resources available to them, and preserving and using ancient relics, they have found what they need to hold the line in their never-ending war.</p><h2>Kalok Shash: The Binding Flame</h2><p>Overall, the faith of the Binding Flame is harsh, simple and compassionate. It is the duty of the strong to protect the weak. It is the duty of the living to fight the fel… whether with the sword, or in the case of the drok by caring for the warriors and producing more warriors. Harsh sacrifice is often necessary, but the loss of any innocent life is a tragedy. With that said, there is a concrete line over which innocence is lost. One of the constant threats faced by the Ghaash’kala are the Carrion Tribe barbarians, mortals who serve the Overlords. The Ghaash’kala call a mortal who chooses to serve evil a fel’gha – “Vile Soul.” They do not waste time or tears on the fel’gha; there are too many threats to the world to worry about redeeming the corrupt. A Ghaash’kala would cast any human who chooses to prey on other humans in this category, and typically one deals with fel’gha with the sword. This can be a difficult challenge for a kala’sha who travels in the south, where many humans seek to take advantage of one another. A greedy innkeeper most likely isn’t a true fel’gha deserving of death… but the Ghaash’kala are disgusted that anyone would seek to harm others for profit.</p><p>While they may give it a different name, the Ghaash’kala channel the power of the Silver Flame. They may shout different invocations, but the visible manifestations of their magic are identical to those of an exorcist of the Silver Flame or a silver pyromancer. A paladin from Thrane and a korta’sha who observe each other in battle recognize that they wield the same forces.</p><p>Some worshippers of the orthodox Church of the Silver Flame might be confused on this. Isn’t Tira Miron the Voice of the Flame? She is - for the orthodox church. A Voice is the anchor of a manifestation of the faith. Tira is the Voice of Flamekeep. But the Ghaash’kala have their own Voice, just as the people of Khalesh did in Sarlona. One can assume that the Voice of Kalok Shash was an orc from long ago, but if so their name has been lost; they are simply known as Korta’Shash.</p><h1>The Chamber</h1><p>Coming Soon.</p><h1>The Shadow Watchers</h1><p>Coming Soon.</p><h1>The Twelve</h1><p>Coming Soon.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":900000,"name":"Threats to Khorvaire","type":"text","_id":"uvlFTeBOyIx9Ahvf","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>The Daelkyr</h1><blockquote><p>A daelkyr knows secrets mortals can’t comprehend and has plans they can’t understand. Some sages believe that the daelkyr are artists and that worlds are their canvas; they destroy civilizations and unleash monsters because, to them, this is a thing of beauty. Others say that the daelkyr exist beyond time, and that their actions only make sense when viewed over the course of millennia. Still others assert that any creature that can understand the motives of the daelkyr will immediately turn to their cause—that it is dangerous to study the daelkyr too closely, lest their revelations destroy all prior understanding and identity. While they may be enigmatic, the daelkyr are unquestionably evil; they shatter innocent lives and entire civilizations without any remorse.</p></blockquote><p>The daelkyr are the lords of madness and the emissaries of Xoriat, who invaded Eberron with a host of mind flayers, beholders, and other foul aberrations. Wherever they walked, the daelkyr reshaped the world in their image, sowing madness and creating monsters. They fused goblins together to create the gibbering dolgrims and crafted the blind dolgaunts from hobgoblin stock.</p><p>The goblinoid champions of Dhakaan fought fiercely. But in the end, it was the ore Gatekeeper druids who closed the portals to Xoriat and drove the daelkyr into Khyber. The Gatekeepers crafted seals to hold both the power of Xoriat and the daelkyr at bay, and as long as those seals remain intact, the lords of madness can't rise from the depths. Today, those seals are thousands of years old and the Gatekeepers are all but forgotten. Mind flayers scheme in the sewers of Sham, and cultists beseech beholder priests for the blessings of Belashyrra, the Lord of Eyes. And in the shadows of Khyber, the daelkyr are waiting.</p><h2>Scions of Madness</h2><p>The daelkyr are immortal and endlessly patient, and their manner of thinking is almost impossible for mortals (or even other outsiders) to understand. For the daelkyr, destroying worlds appears to be a form of art, and until Xoriat and the Material Plane are again coterminous, the daelkyr are indulging their other sordid escapades. Some are poets, musicians, or sculptors, although their works are invariably bizarre and alien to human senses. Their preferred canvas is flesh, for they are the makers of monsters. Dolgrims, dolgaunts, beholders, mind flayers, and other hideous aberrations are the legacy of the daelkyr—living weapons created to destroy life.</p><p>The subterranean citadel of a daelkyr lord usually supports a garrison of dolgrims, dolgaunt lieutenants, and illithid commanders. Each daelkyr also has its personal creations, reflecting its own aesthetic tastes. One might have a preference for oozes. Another breeds psychic vermin, while a third crafts hideous and deadly plants. Their experiments—creating new races by twisting existing creatures into new forms—take time and can not be represented in game terms. A daelkyr can polymorph a creature into something else easily enough; however, creating a new species of monster such as the dolgrim takes years to accomplish.</p><p>The ancient seals placed by the Gatekeepers trap the daelkyr beneath Eberron and keep Xoriat from becoming coterminous, but the daelkyr have not made a concerted effort to destroy these seals. Their motives are inscrutable—above all things, the daelkyr are the lords of the Realm of Madness. Insanity and corruption are the currency they deal in.</p><p>At least six daelkyr (possibly more) inhabit Eberron. The surviving commanders of an army that invaded Khorvaire, they were sealed deep in Khyber and cut off from their home plane. For millennia, the daelkyr have bided their time in the depths of Khyber, waiting for Xoriat to become coterminous once more.</p><h2>The Six Known Daelkyr</h2><p>Six daelkyr are known on Eberron through their cults and legends. Others surely lurk in the depths of Khyber.</p><ul><li>Belashyrra The Lord of Eyes - she is also known to its cultists as the All-Seer or the Glorious Eye. Stories told of Belashyrra in the Shadow Marches whisper that the Lord of Eyes can see every evil deed a person commits, and that those touched by this daelkyr suffer terrible hallucinations that inevitably drive them to violence or death.</li><li>Dyrrn Known to its followers as the Corruptor, the Stealer of Thoughts, the Slithering Lord, and the Foul Labyrinth. In the lore of the Gatekeepers, it is said that Dyrrn plants thoughts in the weak minded-the seeds of terrible ideas that fester and grow. Those who are particularly brilliant often draw the attention of the Foul Labyrinth, which hungers to consume unique minds</li><li>Avassh The Twister of Roots devotes its attentions to plants. Avassh is said to be the source of shambling mounds and myconids, but any unnatural and deadly vegetation might be its work.</li><li>Kyrzin The cults of the Prince of Slime are based in the Shadow Marches and are infamous for cultivating gibbering beasts. Kyrzin creates sentient slimes that can enter humanoid bodies. In some tales, these creatures control their hosts, while in others, they are parasites that burn their way out of the body when it's time to strike.</li><li>Orlassk The Master of Stone is said to have created basilisks, medusas, gorgons, cockatrices, and other monstrosities and aberrations with the power of petrification. Orlassk's citadel is carved into the body of a gargantuan gargoyle that roams the chasms of Khyber.</li><li>Valaara The Crawling Queen works its will on insects, arachnids, and other vermin. Swarms with malign sentience, worms that consume victims from within, cultists that slowly become insects-all of these delight Valaara.</li></ul><h1>The Lord of Blades</h1><blockquote><p>Philosopher, visionary, warlord, messiah . . . abomination, racist, psychopath, tyrant—each of these words has been used to describe the enigmatic Lord of Blades. This warforged leader has established a cult of personality within the Mournland. His commands are carried out by loyal warforged and constructs known as the Blades.</p></blockquote><p>Mystery surrounds the enigmatic Lord of Blades, whose reality is wrapped in legend, and whose very existence threatens the future of the common races of Eberron. The Lord of Blades, a powerful and charismatic warforged, gathers followers from among the living constructs and seeks to build an empire upon the ruins of Cyre, deep in the desolate Mournland. His enclave rises above the broken land as a beacon to other warforged who have grown disenchanted with life among the common races.</p><h2>The Lord of Blades in the World</h2><p>Some speak of the Lord of Blades as a great philosopher and teacher. Others describe him as a power-mad warlord and self-styled prophet who wishes to challenge the weaker, flesh-bound races for supremacy of Khorvaire. His hidden enclave follows a strict regimen that crosses theocratic ideals with the power of a military dictatorship; the Lord of Blades serves as both god and king to his followers. In his camp, the Lord of Blades’ word is law. The warforged who have joined him must accept his rule or be destroyed.</p><p>Where did the Lord of Blades come from? Some tales proclaim that he led the warforged armies of Cyre in the Last War. Contradictory stories paint him as a newer warforged, perhaps even the last to emerge from the Cannith creation foundries before they were dismantled as required by the Thronehold Accords. One dark and disturbing legend claims that the Lord of Blades caused the destruction of Cyre and warns that he plans to repeat this act in each of the Five Nations. Whatever the truth, the Lord of Blades has emerged as a messiah to that segment of the warforged population that seeks to embrace their construct heritage over their living heritage. The vast majority of warforged, however, consider the Lord of Blades to be a false and deluded prophet, or even an abomination that must be destroyed.</p><p>The Lord of Blades has a small but devoted band of fanatical warforged in his camp. He preaches an apocalyptic vision of a future wherein the warforged inherit the world by blade and blood. His most trusted followers, his lieutenants and apostles, have adopted names that honor the Lord of Blades and place them at the head of his band—names such as Saber, Falchion, and Scimitar. His followers hang upon his every word and sermon, memorizing his proclamations and prophecies as part of their daily devotion.</p><p>In battle, the Lord of Blades has few equals. Usually, adventurers must contend with his followers and lieutenants, for to face the Lord of Blades directly is to invite death. His many blades, sharp and deadly, surround him like armor and form a whirlwind of blood and steel when he charges into battle. The only reason why he has not spread his campaign of conquest beyond the Mournland, many believe, is because his army is still too small. A relatively small faction of warforged is attracted to his teachings, and not all of these zealots have been able to yet reach his side. Rumors persist that the Lord of Blades seeks to recover a creation forge and rediscover the secret of warforged construction, but it doesn’t appear that he has yet mastered the ability to churn out new warforged on a regular basis.</p><p>In the meantime, the Lord of Blades’ agents attack Karrnath and Thrane outposts to free warforged slaves, raid Cannith strongholds in search of information on warforged creation, and scour distant Xen’drik for artifacts that may have some ties to modern warforged. His followers have no fear of dying for their cause; they believe the Lord of Blades can repair them and raise them up again in time for the final battle against the flesh-bound races.</p><h1>The Cults of the Dragon Below</h1><p>Coming Soon.</p><h1>The Dreaming Dark</h1><p>Coming Soon.</p><h1>The Lords of Dust</h1><p>Coming Soon.</p><h1>The Order of the Emerald Claw</h1><p>Coming Soon</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"knTUi1bTspduSmIG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.6FshthoIRHlMSzvF"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1670038842259,"modifiedTime":1674934755390,"lastModifiedBy":"knTUi1bTspduSmIG"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"kVrFvPctKtR1SIk0"}
{"name":"5 - The Magic of Eberron","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"The Draconic Prophecy","type":"text","_id":"8PpbjgnkG2Rtv5ER","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>The Draconic Prophecy appears everywhere: in the sky, on the ground, in the pattern of streams flowing over sand, and, more recently, on mortals in the form of dragonmarks. Few creatures can begin to fathom its depths, let alone interpret its shifting nuances that speak to all possible futures.</p></blockquote><p>The dragons of Argonnessen study the world around them for signs and portents. They study the sky above, the pits and caverns below, and the land between, watching for anything that might suggest an omen. The dragons, long-lived and patient in all things, seek meaning in the patterns they see all around them. These patterns play out in the Prophecy, a record of things to come that has been emerging since the creation of the world. Many dragons spend a great deal of effort charting the movement of the moons and stars, studying the patterns of the Dragon Above, interpreting omens, and watching for signs and portents.</p><p>The Draconic Prophecy is as complex and unfathomable as the dragons themselves. A few among the lesser races learn and study snippets of the huge and constantly accumulating text, but only the dragons have the time and perspective to see the Prophecy for what it truly is. There are few traditional texts containing parts of the Prophecy. Instead, the dragons believe that the world itself is a living text that carries and reveals passages of the Prophecy to those who can see it.</p><p>Passages appear throughout the world, above, below, and between. Signs are revealed in the changing shape of the Ring of Siberys. Dragonmarks appear on the sides of mountains or the walls of caves, though some of these can only be read when the moons and stars are in certain alignments, or through the application and proximity of certain dragonshards. Recently, at least as far as dragons are concerned, a new canvas for dragonmarks appeared in the world: the lesser races (as reckoned by the dragons), particularly humans and their closest kin, began to manifest dragonmarks about three thousand years ago.</p><p>The appearance of dragonmarks on the lesser races has led to much debate among the dragons. For whatever reason, the Prophecy apparently has decided to reveal a portion of itself through the humans and their kin. As always, the dragons continue to watch and study, contemplate and discuss, as they seek meaning and understanding in the signs and portents all around them.</p><p>What is the nature of the Prophecy that occupies so much of the dragons’ time? There is, of course, plenty of room for conjecture and interpretation. Even among the dragons, different factions interpret the signs in different ways. The Prophecy hints at events of doom and dread as often as it helps push the world toward exalted events. It is generally believed that the Prophecy points toward transformation, not destruction. Beyond that, the Prophecy remains as alien as the dragons themselves.</p><h1>Using the Prophecy</h1><p>A strange pattern appears on the wall of a deep cavern—a spiraling series of lines, vaguely reminiscent of Draconic characters. A child is born to two full-blooded members of House Cannith, but even at birth she bears an aberrant dragonmark. The moon Aryth eclipses Lharvion at the precise moment that the plane Thelanis becomes coterminous with Eberron. When a dragon sage gathers all these facts, she nods. With a few words, she records her conclusions in the spellshard that lies before her. One more path to the future—one more piece of the draconic Prophecy—has been revealed. The Prophecy is a core element of Eberron. Dragon and fiend battle over its outcome. It might call for a reluctant adventurer to take on the mantle of hero—or it might warn of dire consequences if adventurers slay a hated foe. But what is the draconic Prophecy? And what are effective ways to use it in a campaign?</p><h1>Source and Purpose</h1><p>None can question the power of the draconic Prophecy. Its power as a tool of divination has been proven time and again. But philosophers and sages—human and dragon, celestial and fi end—have long debated the source of its power. How can the paths of the future be mapped out on stone and sky? Is this proof of divine intervention . . . or does such a concrete cosmic plan defy the existence of free-willed gods? Tens of thousands of years of debate and divination have produced no clear answers. Here are a few of the popular theories:</p><ul><li>The Prophecy is a reflection of the ongoing struggle between Khyber and Eberron. The Progenitors shaped reality at the beginning of time, and the Prophecy reflects their divergent desires for their creation. This is the central belief of the dragon religion Thir.</li><li>The Prophecy is the work of the dragon deity Chronepsis, master of fate. The core doctrine of Thir says that Chronepsis is the scribe of the Progenitors. However, certain dragons believe that Chronepsis alone chooses the path of the Prophecy.</li><li>The Prophecy is the creation of Aureon, Sovereign of Law and Lore. This is the popular theory of followers of the Sovereign Host. The doctrine of Thir acknowledges Aureon—Ourelonastrix—as the first prophet, but not as the creator of the Prophecy.</li><li>The Prophecy is a divine force, not unlike the Silver Flame. It draws its power from all living beings. It is shaped by their desires, and it channels their wants. This is how it can predict the future, because it influences people to act in accordance with its predictions.</li><li>Each of the thirteen Outer Planes has an underlying consciousness. Eberron is where the planes converge, and the Prophecy is the result of the debate between these planar voices.</li><li>The Prophecy is the ultimate source of magical energy. Magic has the power to reshape reality, and the draconic Prophecy is the ultimate expression of this.</li></ul><p>Even those who agree on the nature of the Prophecy argue about its purpose. For much of the history of Argonnessen, the followers of Thir have held to the belief that the Prophecy is the record of creation, and that the purpose of the dragons is to watch and record until creation runs its course. This means they can prevent others from tampering with the course of destiny, but should not manipulate it themselves.</p><p>The dragons of the Chamber counter that Ourelonastrix and Hezcalipa used their knowledge of the Prophecy to defeat the Overlords in the Age of Demons. These dragons claim that the Prophecy is a tool, a gift to allow those wise enough to read it some control over the future. In their view, dragons should be on guard against other forces who seek to control this power. The Lords of Dust have always sought to use the Prophecy as a weapon against their foes. The elves of the Undying Court have unraveled many of its mysteries. Now, some among the lesser nondragons seek to use the Prophecy as a tool, if they can only master its secrets.</p><h1>The Nature of the Prophecy</h1><p>The draconic Prophecy has existed since the dawn of time. Dragons and demons have sought its power.</p><p>But what is the Prophecy? What form does it take? How can people fight over its outcome? And how can an infallible prophecy work in a game that is, ultimately, defined by player choices?</p><p>The key is that the draconic Prophecy is a living thing. It has never been fully recorded because it is constantly growing and evolving. The Prophecy is a map showing many paths that the future might take, and revealing dependencies. Consider the following: If the King of Breland is assassinated on the day of the gargoyle’s first victory, there will be war in the west. If there is war between Droaam and Breland, and if the last child of the storm faces the three daughters, the first hag will return.</p><p>This is the nature of the Prophecy. It is a web that is constantly unfolding, and the future is formed by threads from thousands of evolving events. This is how the Chamber and the Lords of Dust use the Prophecy as a weapon. Find an outcome you desire, then trace back the path of events that will make it happen. If the Lords of Dust want Sora Kell to return, they must see to it that King Boranel is slain on the same day that Carralag the gargoyle wins the Race of Eight Winds in Sharn. This will lead to war . . . and that paves the way for the next convergence they wish to control. Meanwhile, if the Chamber can prevent Carralag’s victory or Boranel’s death, it has staved off this fate . . . though it might have set another path in motion. This is the trick to dealing with the Lords of Dust and the Chamber; both groups are often working toward long-term goals that can’t even be seen without the use of the Prophecy. The Chamber might help stop a massacre, or it might cause a massacre—in either case the dragons care nothing about the victims. They are concerned only with the chain of events that are set in motion, and it might take years, decades, or longer for matters to play out.</p><h1>Form of the Prophecy</h1><p>Typically, adventurers encounter the Prophecy in one of three ways.</p><p>Signs and Portents: A convergence of moons and planes. A symbol revealed by an earthquake. Three dragonmarked heirs slain by fire. These are some of the ways in which the Prophecy is made manifest. But taken alone, none of these manifestations have meaning. It’s like glancing at tea leaves or seeing two crows on a dead oak tree—without proper training, the omen cannot be interpreted. And the draconic Prophecy is far more complex than tea leaves or tarot cards. In the examples given above, all three of the events could be linked together. Moon, rune, and deaths are all pieces of the puzzle, and knowledge of past events might be just as crucial to success. Most creatures require decades to learn to interpret the simplest signs of the Prophecy, and it takes centuries to truly understand it. Even among the long-lived dragons, few have the patience and intelligence required to become true prophets. As such, adventurers rarely fi nd a piece of the Prophecy that they can interpret on their own; instead, they need to fi nd someone who can help them understand its meaning.</p><p>In the past, the symbols that appeared on the earth were called dragonmarks. These days, they are usually called Prophecy marks. The design of these marks is quite similar to those found on flesh, but every mark is different; each line has meaning to one who knows how to read them. If a character who speaks Draconic makes a DC 30 Spellcraft check, she gains a hint about the meaning of a mark, to a maximum of five words. For example, she might recognize the concepts of “king,” “victory,” and “moving stone.” Although interesting, this hint rarely provides full meaning, and might actually be misleading.</p><p>A small Prophecy mark might be the size of a human fist. The largest marks are so big that they can be seen properly only from a great height. All marks radiate a strong aura of universal magic and occasionally shimmer with a blue-green radiance similar to the color of dragonmarks. Prophecy marks slowly repair themselves if damaged. It’s possible to remove a small mark whole, but if a mark is simply damaged, it eventually re-forms.</p><p>The true nature of Prophecy marks is as mysterious as the Prophecy itself. In Xen’drik, explorers have found eldritch machines from the Age of Giants that seem to use Prophecy marks as a source of power, and many forces in Khorvaire—notably House Cannith, the Twelve, and the elemental binders of Zilargo—are working to unlock this secret.</p><p>Translations: A Prophecy mark on a cavern wall won’t provide much insight into the Prophecy. The personal notes of a dragon scholar who has spent centuries collecting pieces of the Prophecy? That’s another matter. The challenge for humans is that dragons typically use spellshards to record knowledge. A spellshard formed for a dragon is the size of a small boulder. Some dragons prefer to carve their thoughts in stone; many lairs have a chamber of words, and adventurers could find insights about the Prophecy written there. Although few mortal non-dragons have truly mastered the draconic Prophecy, a number of sages have studied it, and collected the writings of dragon prophets. Adventurers might find useful translations in the journal of, say, a dead cataclysm mage.</p><p>The dragons of Argonnessen have created many records about the Prophecy. A translation could simply record events of the past—the shape the Prophecy finally took—but even this can be an important tool for interpreting future signs. Some records reveal possibilities—multiple paths that the future can take, depending on what events come to pass. Other dragon writings focus on a single chain of possibility—the path that the writers are working to achieve.</p><p>The precise form of these writings varies based on the author. A translation of the Prophecy could take the form of poetry, a formal treatise, or a few cryptic words. It has meaning to the author, but it might still puzzle the random reader.</p><p>Prophets: The simplest way to read meaning into the Prophecy is to know someone who can read its signs. The role of the dragon prophet has already been discussed, but other options exist. A deathless elf or disguised rakshasa could offer insight into a path of the Prophecy. A scholar might piece together a translation—imperfect, but something to work with. Or a dragonmarked character could have a sudden and vivid prophetic dream. A gift of Chronepsis? Insight flowing directly from the source of the Prophecy and through his dragonmark? Or part of a devious quori scheme?</p><h1>Prophetic Organizations</h1><h2>The Chamber</h2><p>The Chamber is a loose alliance dragons dedicated to unraveling the draconic prophecy and using it to shape the future of Eberron. Its members share resources (including their agents), and have established a network of safe houses and support across Khorvaire and Stormreach. The dragons gather and share information, and those with common goals sometimes work together.</p><p>Still, the dragons of the Chamber have divergent interests. Some wish to recover lost artifacts from the Age of Demons. Some want to observe the lesser races, to see the role they play in the unfolding Prophecy. Others oppose the Lords of Dust and other forces who seek to manipulate the Prophecy. A few wish to manipulate the Prophecy themselves. All dragons of the Chamber are working in the interests of Argonnessen and the dragons as a race—the Eyes of Chronepsis quickly eliminate a dragon who threatens his homeland. But an outcome that is good for Argonnessen might be devastating for Khorvaire.</p><p>Although the dragons of the Chamber cooperate, each dragon has his own network of agents. Dragons of the Chamber rarely fight one another, but if they are competing over a particular turning point in the Prophecy, they have no difficulty setting their agents at odds.</p><p>The Chamber is a young organization by draconic standards, fewer than four thousand years old. Most Chamber observers are mature adults or younger. Some older dragons are tied to the Chamber, including those who founded the organization. Most of these elders, however, have returned to Argonnessen to guide activities from the Tapestry, leaving their children to directly manage their interests.</p><p>The Chamber can be an excellent patron for adventurers, because its members possess wealth and the knowledge required to draw adventurers into the Prophecy. The key is that the Chamber is unpredictable even as a patron. These dragons are always looking to the distant goal, and even a friendly dragon might sacrifice non-dragon lives for what she sees as the greater good.</p><p>Any number of critical events could have been set in motion by the Chamber. It’s quite possible that a precursor to the Chamber instigated the migration of humanity to Khorvaire because that group knew it was the only way humans would develop dragonmarks. Likewise, the cabal might have encouraged the formation of Galifar to place limits on the power of the dragonmarked houses. Such discoveries are part of the tone of Eberron—how much of what you take for granted is the result of draconic manipulation?</p><h2>The Lords of Dust</h2><p>The immortal Lords of Dust still remember the war between dragon and fi end. Many are willing to wait for their vengeance; once the Overlords of the Age of Demons are released, the dragons will suffer. But a few enjoy matching wits with the dragons, whether they target rogues, agents of the Chamber, or the draconic Prophecy itself. As immortals, the sages of the Lords of Dust have had tens of thousands of years to study the Prophecy. A few of the members of the Council of Ashtakala have been fighting a long shadow war with the dragons, using the Prophecy as a battleground. The rakshasas have won their share of victories, and some of the darker events in history could be a result of this manipulation. The rakshasas also enjoying using their knowledge of the Prophecy to set up situations in which the dragon prophets know that draconic interference would have disastrous results in the future; as such, the dragons must either use agents dictated by the Prophecy—adventurers, perhaps—or play into the rakshasas’ twisted hands.</p><p>Durastoran Wyrmbreaker has been one of the most active lords in this battle over the Prophecy. Wyrmbreaker has a force of lesser fiends and human agents at his disposal, scattered across Khorvaire.</p><h2>The Talons of Tiamat</h2><p>One shadow from the Age of Demons continues to haunt the dragons to this day: Tiamat. Even in her prison, Tiamat holds the power to seduce and corrupt dragons . . . and some join her of their own free will, dreaming of the power they will possess when she is freed. </p><p>The Talons of Tiamat are the cult of the Daughter of Khyber. Humanoids and fi ends allied with Tiamat could possess the half-dragon template; dragons that serve the Daughter of Khyber might gain the half-fiend template as a result of her corrupting touch. The Cult can draw on the spawn of Tiamat, vile creatures born from tainted dragon’s eggs. The spawn have always appeared in small numbers in Argonnessen, a lingering reminder of Tiamat’s presence. But now the numbers of the spawn are growing, and the Talons of Tiamat are gathering these forces to build an army.</p><p>Even though she is bound, Tiamat occasionally stirs in her prison; at these times, she is more conscious and active than any of the other Overlords of the Age of Demons. It’s said that she can see through the eyes of any evil dragon, and that she can whisper into the hearts of dragons as they sleep. Her chosen agents can commune with her, and at times they have even summoned aspects of her into the world—far weaker than Tiamat in her full glory, but fearsome nonetheless. Each time that Tiamat has awoken in the past, that event has brought disaster to Argonnessen. Now she is stirring once more, and the prophets say that the doom of Argonnessen could be at hand.</p><p>The Talons serve an Overlord of the first age, and rakshasas and other fiends appear among their ranks. As such, they can be seen as a branch of the Lords of Dust. However, the Talons rarely coordinate their actions with the Council of Ashtakala. Most believe that Tiamat is the only true Daughter of Khyber, and the rakshasa rajahs are merely usurpers with delusions of grandeur.</p><p>The agents of Tiamat have many goals that could take them into the wider world. They oppose the Chamber and the Eyes of Chronepsis, and adventurers could be caught in the middle of such a conflict. The cultists are gathering artifacts and tools in preparation for war in Argonnessen. They are spreading the spawn of Tiamat across the world, creating hidden nests beneath major cities. Above all, they are working to manipulate the Prophecy in ways that will result in the release of Tiamat. If a Dungeon Master wants to pit adventurers against a significant number of truly evil dragons, the Talons of Tiamat are an excellent choice. Not all dragons touched by Tiamat serve in her cult. Some simply grow hateful in solitude, giving in to greed and hunger. Any ravager or rogue could be a victim of Tiamat’s taint; they might simply terrorize a region, or they could one day be recruited to serve the Talons.</p><h2>The Twelve</h2><p>The leaders of the Dragonmarked houses aren’t fools. Over the course of centuries, they realized the dragons were watching them. It took time, but eventually they discovered the reasons for this observation. The lords of the Twelve learned of the connection between the dragonmarks and the Prophecy, and found out that many dragons believed the dragonmarked should all be destroyed, eradicated as thoroughly as the line of Vol and the Mark of Death. They knew that it might be only a matter of time before the dragons took action.</p><p>The barons chose not to share this terrifying discovery with the rank and file of their houses. Two centuries ago, they created a secret division of the Twelve dedicated to draconic affairs. This Wyrmwatch Council pursued a number of paths. Some members focused on the draconic Prophecy, trying to discern if their dragonmarks could directly influence the Prophecy. Others were dedicated to studying dragons and locating or developing spells, tools, or strategies that could give the houses a fighting chance in a war with Argonnessen. The irony of the situation is that these efforts to interfere with the Prophecy are the very acts that could start such a war.</p><p>With the onset of the Last War, resources were redirected to take advantage of the conflict. The work of the Council lay idle for almost a century. But now, as peace returns to Khorvaire, the lords of the Twelve have reactivated this unit. Time will tell if this decision was a wise precaution or the prelude to disaster.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":200000,"name":"A History of Dragons","type":"text","_id":"Hs0KQ0xfkzRO5Hf4","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>The history of dragons stretches back to the dawn of time. Each flight has its own heroes, triumphs, and defeats, and over the course of tens of thousands of years much truth has been lost or consumed by legend. This section addresses events Khorvairian historians have studied, no doubt but a few glittering coins in the vast hoard of draconic history.</p></blockquote><h1>The Progenitor Wyrms</h1><p>The wisest dragons contend that the world was born in battle. According to myth, the emptiness before creation was the domain of three mighty dragons. Golden Siberys was the source of all magic. Gentle Eberron was the fountain of life. Cruel Khyber was the master of secret knowledge, and of the powers that lurk in the darkness. Together, they held dominion over the fate of all, and they pondered the proper shape of the universe.</p><p>In the beginning, the Progenitors worked together. They started with the thirteen planes, but as they molded reality, rifts began to form between them. Dark Khyber grew greedy, and noble Siberys responded by becoming more forceful; each sought greater influence in the work. Daanvi, Fernia, and Irian bear the prevailing mark of Siberys. Kythri, Mabar, and Xoriat show the dominant touch of Khyber. Eberron sought to mediate but could not bridge the divide.</p><p>When it came time to create the final, central plane, the tensions between Siberys and Khyber could not be contained. The dark one tore into her sibling, mortally wounding the gold dragon and scattering his scales across the sky. Although not powerful enough to defeat her, Eberron knew that Khyber could not be allowed to benefit from her deeds. The gentle one refused to fight Khyber with claw and tooth. Instead, Eberron embraced her, trapping Khyber within her smothering coils. Eberron called on the powers of life, giving birth to soil, tree, and ocean, and so transformed herself into a living prison that Khyber could never escape.</p><p>Thus Eberron became the world on which all life grew. To this day, she nurtures and sustains all. Siberys’s remains became the ring around the world; his scattered scales became the stars. Khyber remains trapped within—the Dragon Below, the Mother of Monsters, the source of all darkness—forever struggling to escape and bring an end to it all.</p><h1>The First Age</h1><p>In the wake of the battle of the Progenitors, life emerged on the new world. Siberys had fallen in battle, but power remained within his blood. Filled with the purest essence of magic, that blood fell on Eberron, merging life and magic to produce new creatures with the strength of both Progenitors: dragons. Where the blood of Siberys struck the clouds, silver dragons were born. It fell on the cold peaks, and white dragons rose from the ice. It struck the swamps, and black dragons emerged from the dark depths. And so all the dragons were born, mighty and proud, possessing the mystical power of Siberys and the vibrant life force of Eberron.</p><p>Few of the creatures of the modern age existed at the dawn of time. The titans of Xen’drik were in their infancy, possessed of power but lacking knowledge. The lesser races had not been born; the dark creatures had not been spawned. So it was that wild flights of dragons soared above the world, reveling in their might.</p><p>The dragons’ only true match were the couatls, the feathered serpents of Sarlona. For all their power, dragons are mortal creatures. They reproduce, they grow old, and in time they die. The couatls stood outside the cycle of life; legends say that the couatls were formed from the pure blood of Siberys before it struck Eberron, and that, as a result, they were truly immortal. They were reborn only after death, so that their numbers remained constant. Though powerful, the couatls kept to Sarlona, leaving the dragons to explore the world.</p><h2>The Blood of Khyber</h2><p>For untold millennia, the dragons were the sole lords of Eberron. Then a new threat emerged. Khyber was bound in the depths of Eberron, but this did not eliminate the dark dragon’s power. In time, a host of horrors spawned in the depths. Rakshasas, aboleths, and other terrors emerged to lay claim to the world above. The greatest were the Overlords, fiends with such power that they could almost be called gods. At that time, the dragons were organized into simple flights, which fought with one another as often as not. Scattered and wild, they were no match for the Overlords of Khyber.</p><h2>The Draconic Prophecy</h2><p>After the mighty fiends consolidated their hold on the surface world, they ruled over a nightmare kingdom for hundreds of thousands of years. The once-proud dragons were forced into slavery and servitude. The fiendish dominion might have continued until the  end of time, if not for the couatl Hezcalipa and a blue dragon named Ourelonastrix. Working together over the course of centuries, these two visionaries studied the sky and stars, and compared their findings with mysterious patterns that appeared on the earth. They became convinced that such study could reveal a map of the future, an outline of the myriad paths history might follow. Ourelonastrix believed it to be the wisdom of the Progenitors, the very blueprint of reality. He called it the draconic Prophecy, authored by Eberron and Siberys themselves.</p><h2>The Great War</h2><p>The draconic Prophecy gave Ourelonastrix insights into the weaknesses of the demonic Overlords. Even more, it gave the dragon and his kin a sense of hope, the belief that dragons were part of something greater. Following the path of prophecy, Ourelonastrix and Hezcalipa rallied their peoples against the children of Khyber, setting in motion a war that would continue for thousands of years. Despite their raw power—or perhaps, because of it—the Overlords were scattered and overconfident. This allowed the combined might of the dragon–couatl alliance to defeat them one by one.</p><p>Despite this advantage, the war seemed hopeless. The Overlords were truly immortal. The defeat of an Overlord was temporary at best, and no simple spell could bind them. Then Hezcalipa’s studies uncovered a path to victory. Indeed, the outcome appeared ordained. Still, the cost was terrible. Led by Hezcalipa, the couatls sacrificed almost their entire race, forging their immortal essence into a pure force that could hold the Overlords and their dire followers. A few demons escaped, but the war was won.</p><p>Although the dragons fought fiercely, some believe they abandoned the couatls at the end, refusing to share the cost of the final sacrifice. It’s possible that this was a matter of fear, although that seems unlikely. It might be that, being mortal, the dragons simply didn’t have the spiritual energy required. Perhaps the dragons survival was a calculated decision. The sacrifice of the couatls removed both celestials and fiends from Eberron, leaving the dragons as masters of the Prophecy and the most powerful beings in the world.</p><h1>Expansion and Withdrawal</h1><p>The Great War against the demons united the dragons. It forced them to set aside their petty rivalries and to master the mystical powers that had long lain dormant in them. The surviving dragons were more powerful than ever before, but their population had been devastated by battle. Following the defeat of the Overlords, most of the surviving dragons retreated to the sanctuary of Argonnessen. The elders gathered in the first great Conclave and laid the foundation of draconic culture that remains in place to this day. The survivors spent tens of thousands of years nursing their wounds, rebuilding their flights, identifying and studying the signs of the Prophecy, and honing the magical gifts they had developed during the war. In time, some began to look beyond Argonnessen, and to explore the lands they rediscovered.</p><p>Sixty thousand years ago, the dragons began spreading across Eberron again. They found dozens of growing civilizations—kingdoms of giants and titans in Xen’drik, primitive clans of dwarves in Frostfell, nomadic groups of shifters in Sarlona, and nascent goblins in Khorvaire. Some merely wished to study the lesser creatures. A few came as mentors, foremost among them the descendants of Ourelonastrix. These dragons shared the secrets of magic with giants, curious to see what innovations these promising creatures might develop. But the bulk of the dragons chose the path of conquest. Flights of dragons carved out dominions across the world.</p><p>For most of the dragons, it began as a game—one with a high cost in life among non-dragons. In time, however, the struggle turned dragon against dragon. Friendly rivalries became bitter. The blood of dragons flowed. And as the troubles spread, the Daughter of Khyber stirred in the Pit of Five Sorrows. Hundreds of dragons fell under her sway, and the spawn of Tiamat rose from tainted broods. Given time to spread, this corruption could have destroyed Argonnessen. Fortunately for the dragons, the watchful Eyes of Chronepsis were able to identify the tainted dragons, and the militant Light of Siberys brought an end to the corruption.</p><p>The Conclave gathered at a massive natural aerie in the heart of Argonnessen. There the students of the draconic Prophecy presented their findings. To this day, the records of this gathering remain privileged information even within Argonnessen, shared only with respected and powerful elders. Most dragons believe that the seers linked Tiamat’s rising power to the spread of draconic activity across the globe—opining that the influence of the dragon lords in turn empowered the Daughter of Khyber. One fact is known: Following the council, the Conclave called on the scattered dragons to return to Argonnessen. The age of draconic expansion was at an end.</p><h1>The Devastation of Xen'drik</h1><p>Explorers in Xen’drik, Q’barra, or Adar might stumble across a weathered statue or faded image scratched into a cavern wall, but the dragons left few traces of their dominion . . . with one exception. The giants of Xen’drik were the most advanced non-dragons of the age, and they had learned much in their interactions with the dragons. Those who worked with Ourelonastrix’s students used draconic magic to carve out empires and dominate their continent. The arcane arts spread, and soon the giants began to explore new approaches to magic. As powerful as they are, the dragons are mired in tradition, and certain paths they refuse to tread. The giants of long-dead empires, such as the Cul’sir Empire and the Group of Eleven, had no such qualms—their exploration of blood magic and other dark arts diverged wildly from the codified teachings of Ourelonastrix.</p><p>Nonetheless, the dragons remained uninvolved. The elders of many flights studied the draconic Prophecy, but agreed that it was best not to manipulate its outcome. They simply traced its myriad paths and watched as fate chose its course.</p><p>Then the quori came to Xen’drik. The motivation for this extraplanar incursion remains a mystery, but the giant records portray the quori simply as ruthless invaders. Other evidence suggests that the quori merely sought refuge from a disaster on their own plane, or even retaliation against acts of aggression instigated by the lords of Xen’drik. Whatever the root of the war, it was a struggle that lasted for centuries. Powerful mystical and psionic forces were unleashed by both sides, and, in time, nearly all the arcane knowledge the giants possessed was turned to the war effort. In Argonnessen, students of the draconic Prophecy warned that this struggle could shake the planes themselves, but the Conclave insisted that the dragons stand aloof. The outcome is known to any student of history; the giants unleashed forces that tore Dal Quor from its orbit, bringing a sudden and terrible end to the conflict.</p><p>The giants’ gambit devastated their continent and shook the foundations of Eberron. Their former slaves, the elves, rose up against their weakened masters. Desperate, the giants began harnessing power once more, preparing to unleash the same forces that had vanquished Dal Quor. Perhaps they thought victory was possible, but many historians believe it was pure nihilism—if the titans couldn’t rule the world, they would destroy it. The dragons saw the threat traced out in the Prophecy. Shocked and alarmed at the effect of the forces already unleashed by the giants, this time they chose to act. A scaled army poured forth from Argonnessen, with flights of all colors led by the militant wyrms of the Light of Siberys. The conflict was brutal, and its outcome never in doubt. The dragons had no interest in holding territory. They made no effort to avoid civilian casualties; they brought fire, fang, and epic magic to bear in the most destructive ways imaginable. In the end, nothing was left of the proud nations of Xen’drik. Giant, elf, and all other cultures of the land were laid low by the dragons, and powerful curses ensured that the giants would never again threaten the world.</p><p>Their mission accomplished, the dragons returned to Argonnessen to brood. All agreed that the people of Xen’drik would never have posed such a threat if the dragons had not shared the secrets of magic. The Conclave called the event kurash Ourelonastrix—Aureon’s Folly—and forbade any flight from sharing the secrets of Argonnessen with lesser beings.</p><h1>The Elf-Dragon Wars</h1><p>Although the destruction of Xen’drik was monumental, some of the continent’s denizens did survive. While the dragons brooded, elf refugees established the nation of Aerenal. Thousands of years of research into necromancy and the energies of Argonnessen produced the Undying Court, an alliance of deathless elves with a gestalt power that rivaled the Overlords of the first age. Since that time—nearly twenty-five thousand years before the founding of Galifar—dragons and elves have been at war. The tides of strife ebb and flow, and centuries might pass between battles... but sooner or later the dragons return to fight once more. The basis of this age-old conflict, and its conduct, is another of the mysteries of Argonnessen.</p><p>Many find it impossible to imagine that the Aereni could stand against the force that utterly destroyed Xen’drik. In truth, the elves have never faced the full power of Argonnessen. The strike on Xen’drik was carried out by the full, unified force of Argonnessen; the elf–dragon wars have involved only a few flights from the Light of Siberys. The fact that the Undying Court has been able to hold off the dragons remains an impressive feat, but it has not faced the power that ravaged a continent. Those who study this puzzling behavior ask: Why not? What motivates this seemingly endless struggle? If the dragons truly wish to eliminate the elves, why don’t they commit their full forces to the task? If they don’t care enough to do so, why do they continue to fight in such piecemeal fashion?</p><p>One theory is that the dragons despise the extensive practice of necromancy, even when it draws on the positive energy of Irian, but do not view it with the same abhorrence as the giants’ planar studies. Thus, they cannot agree en-masse that Aerenal should be laid low. Another possibility is that the struggle is a form of exercise for the dragons, a proving ground for the younger warriors of the Light of Siberys. Conversely, it might be that the wars are fought to test the elves and harden them for some future conflict, just as a soldier will sharpen his blade in preparation for battles to come. The dragons might be unwilling to share the secrets of their power with lesser races, but they can still push the lower creatures to reach their full potential. The long struggle with the dragons has certainly forced the Aereni wizards and Tairnadal warriors to master the arts of war and magic.</p><p>The lords of Argonnessen offer no explanations for their actions, nor do they negotiate. Only two instances of elves and dragons working side by side are known, and both involve the noble line of the House of Vol. Following the appearance of the Mark of Death, a number of green dragons began working with the line of Vol. This alliance produced the half-green dragon Erandis. Allies of Vol claim that this was intended to forge a bond between the two races and bring an end to the wars. Others believe that the emerald dragons sought to gain control of the Mark of Death through their half-dragon offspring. In the end, Erandis d’Vol did unite Aerenal and Argonnessen... in a quest to eradicate the line of Vol. But this alliance was short-lived and involved minimal communication between the allies. Once the house of Vol fell into shadow, the dragons returned to Argonnessen, and in a few centuries the cycle of war began anew.</p><h1>Vvaraak's Betrayal</h1><p>Throughout time, rogue dragons have pursued their own agendas and dreams. Still, in the aftermath of Aureon’s Folly and the destruction of Xen’drik, few dared to share the secrets of Argonnessen with lesser creatures. One such rebel was the Emerald Claw, father of Erandis d’Vol, and it destroyed him. A more well-regarded rogue was Vvaraak, the black dragon who trained the first Gatekeepers, and brought the secrets of druidic magic to Khorvaire. A true child of Eberron, Vvaraak foresaw a disaster that would wound the world itself. The Conclave had no interest in this struggle; just as the dragons had stood aside while the giants of Xen’drik battled Dal Quor, the elders of the Conclave told Vvaraak that they would act when a clear threat to Argonnessen existed, and not before.</p><p>Frustrated, Vvaraak abandoned her elders and her flight, traveled across the world, and began training humanoids and other creatures in the use of natural magic. Although she is best known for teaching the orcs of the west coast of Khorvaire, Vvaraak had other students. Some Seren druids attribute their skill to the teachings of the Ebon Mother, and lizardfolk boast Gatekeepers in Q’barra and Xen’drik. Vvaraak stayed in the Shadow Marches for less than a century, and her final fate is unknown. Perhaps she lived out her final days in humanoid form, moving among her students and hiding from the angry Eyes of Chronepsis. Perhaps she descended into Khyber to teach the derro and other denizens of the deep. Some say that she returned to Argonnessen, that her act of rebellion was actually a carefully calculated move on behalf of the Conclave. If so, it could be that the dragons subtly planned and implemented both the destruction of the Dhakaani Empire and the defeat of the daelkyr.</p><p>Of course, it’s possible that the Xoriat incursion was not the threat Vvaraak foresaw. If this is the case, what monumental danger still lies ahead?</p><h1>Dragonmarks and The Chamber</h1><p>The Prophecy is constantly evolving. As the actions of the present open new paths to the future, these routes are revealed in stone and storm, in the convergent motions of moon and plane. A few thousand years ago—within the estimated life span of a gold dragon—the Prophecy revealed itself in a new form.</p><p>Dragonmarks.</p><p>Traced across the flesh of a number of the lesser races, these sigils are more than a source of mystic power. To a student of the draconic Prophecy, the actions of the dragonmarked provide insight into the paths of the Prophecy, much as a lesser augur might read hints of the future in the movements of birds. The appearance of the dragonmarks sent shock waves across Argonnessen. Why were the marks appearing on humanoids instead of the far more ancient and nobler dragons? Would this give humanoids the power to shift the path of the Prophecy? Some declared that this transition from stone to short-lived flesh was a sign that the Prophecy was nearing its end... an end that would herald the death of Eberron and the birth of a new reality.</p><p>Many among the militant Light of Siberys urged the Conclave to destroy the dragonmarked, to prevent the Lords of Dust or other enemies from using them. Other dragons argued that this was a manifestation of the will of Eberron, and destroying it would be a blasphemous act that could have cataclysmic results. While the Conclave considered, a new voice was heard in the tumult. Young dragons of all colors challenged the passive philosophy of their elders. The world was changing; this new age called for direct observation and, when necessary, manipulation of the lesser beings. After long debate, the Conclave agreed to give the members of this new movement a chance to explore their theories. Stern warnings were issued about empowering Tiamat, however, and a set of guidelines limiting involvement was drafted. Freed, at least in part, from the restrictions that branded Vvaraak and others anathema, the younger dragons formed the territory known as the Tapestry in Argonnessen. A select few were chosen to travel across the world, to monitor the dragonmarked, to search for other signs of the Prophecy, and to oppose the Lords of Dust and others who worked against the interests of Argonnessen. This group is known as Calemaryx—the Chamber.</p><p>Over the course of the last three thousand years, the Chamber has spread across Eberron. Its agents are concentrated in Khorvaire, since this is the center of the dragonmarked, a stronghold of the Lords of Dust, and the nexus for events involving the Prophecy. Many dragons are still dubious about the mission of the Chamber, and the Eyes of Chronepsis are always ready to eliminate any agent of the Chamber who goes too far. It is a dangerous life, but those who serve the Chamber are shaping the future of Eberron.</p><h1>Tiamat, The Daughter of Khyber</h1><p>In Eberron, deities do not walk the earth. This is true even of the Dragon Gods. The dragons point to Bahamut’s image in the sky, but the platinum dragon has never set foot on Eberron, and his existence is a matter of faith, not fact.</p><p>Although misconceptions abound, Tiamat’s existence on Eberron is no exception for she is not truly a god. Rather, she is one of the mightiest fiends of the Age of Demons, a true daughter of the Dragon Below. Each of the Overlords has its own mystical dominion; for Tiamat, that province is dragons. Khyber and Siberys were siblings, and the taint of Khyber lies hidden in every dragon. Tiamat has the power to draw that out, corrupting and commanding the children of Eberron and Siberys. The chromatic dragons are especially vulnerable to her wiles, but even metallic dragons are at risk.</p><p>During the Age of Demons, Tiamat was the most feared of the Overlords, as she turned an army of dragons and her own twisted spawn against their kin. She was finally defeated by the couatls and bound in Argonnessen’s Pit of Five Sorrows. Her corrupted spawn were utterly destroyed. Still, so great was the fear she engendered that the dragons placed her among the pantheon of dragon deities and traced her symbol in the stars. Perhaps they hoped that if Tiamat found a place in the heavens, she might never return to Eberron.</p><p>Tiamat remains bound to this day, but her power is still felt in the world. She has followers among the Lords of Dust, and she is served by an alliance of dragons and other creatures—the Talons of Tiamat. These cultists work to free the Daughter of Khyber, and they have already succeeded at the first stage of their plans, arranging for the reemergence of Tiamat’s dreadful spawn. The Prophecy warns of the terrible consequences of Tiamat’s return; now her cult works to fulfill the conditions of the Prophecy, even as the draconic Light of Siberys fights to keep this apocalypse at bay.</p><p>Even though Tiamat isn’t a true goddess, clerics who worship the Daughter of Khyber do receive spells, just as warforged devoted to the Lord of Blades do. Tiamat herself does not grant this power, but faith and devotion to her dark ideals empowers the dedicated cleric.</p><p>Like all the Overlords of the Age of Demons, Tiamat is bound in her prison and can infl uence the world only through her agents. In her true form, she has power sufficient to threaten entire nations, and the ability to corrupt and control dragons. It is possible that her followers will find a way to grant their dark lady the ability to manifest, at least partially, in the world. This would be a cataclysmic event indeed.</p><h1>Tiamat, Rising</h1><p>For most in Eberron, dragons are creatures of myth and legend. Bards sing of the struggle between Prince Thrane and the Burning Dragon, and the Gatekeepers pay homage to Vvaraak. Still, few of the lesser races expect to ever see a dragon.</p><p>Recently, purported sightings of dragons are becoming more common. Tales of dragons joining in battles during the Last War have been heard. More than one adventuring party has returned to civilization with tales of dragon encounters. The settlers of Q’barra claim that a dragon-fiend named Rhashaak lurks in the deep jungle. Many report that dragons can be found in areas outside Argonnessen, whether hidden in urban shadows or desolate lairs.</p><p>In truth, the number of dragons abroad is greater than it has been since the fall of the giants. The Eyes of Chronepsis have relaxed their watch since the formation of the Chamber, and the number of rogue dragons has grown dramatically. Most rogues keep a low profile, hiding among humanity or manipulating events from the shadows. But dragons do exist in the world, and in far greater numbers than most people imagine.</p><p>And now Tiamat is stirring once more. Her cult is gaining followers among both dragons and nondragons. The spawn of Tiamat are appearing in increasing numbers, bursting forth from corrupted eggs. The Light of Siberys is working ceaselessly to reinforce the wards in the Pit of Five Sorrows and to hunt down the Talons of Tiamat within Argonnessen. But her cultists have spread to other lands, and it could be only a matter of time before the Daughter of Khyber returns to threaten the world.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":50000,"name":"Magic vs Technology","type":"text","_id":"9QyTyC6MA74wzdRd","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>\"Eberron is a world of magical industry. Artificers and wizards fill a similar role to our own world’s engineers and scientists, using schools of magic instead of scientific disciplines. However, Eberron is not a “high magic” setting. Spells above third level are rare in Khorvaire, with such magic generally only available to the wealthy. Magic above fifth level is a thing of legends. Instead, Khorvaire is defined by its application of everyday “wide magic” — clever use of cantrips and low-level spells to make life easier.</p><p>While Eberron has a similar aesthetic to steampunk and related genres, it isn’t a world of mundane technology, steam power, clockwork constructs, and the like. The Eberron setting is built on the assumption that in a world with pervasive low-level magic, there would be little need for mundane inventions because magic has taken their place. So instead of the linear advancements of steampunk settings that mirror the real world, Eberron can be a world without mundane technology due to the pervasiveness of arcane technology. For example, the trains don’t need to run on steam or electric power — not because of a primitive understanding of science, but because you don’t need steam if you can bind powerful elementals in Khyber dragonshards and tap their power instead.\" </p></blockquote><p>Simply put - there are no guns in Eberron. You can play a gunslinger as is if you limit yourself to a crossbow. There are no \"inventors\" as a non-magical class in Eberron. All alchemists undertake their work via magical means, and not the mundane ones typically outlined.</p><p>That's not to say that we can't work together to reskin the flavor of the gunslinger, alchemist or inventor classes to make them more appropriate to Eberron. We absolutely can, and we can do so without changing a single mechanical thing.</p><p>Each of the three classes I mentioned above (along with a re-flavored version of the wizard) can take the place of the one class Eberron has that Pathfinder 2E doesn't have a great analog for: The Artificer. I'm going to briefly quote the D&amp;D 3E Eberron Campaign Setting here: \"Artificers understand magic on a different level from spellcasters, and do not cast spells as wizards and clerics do. They have an amazing facility with magic items and constructs, and in many ways, they keep the magical world of Eberron running.\"</p><p>Want to play an artificer? You can play a wizard. Only instead of preparing spells from a spellbook each day that you then cast when needed throughout the day, you infuse objects from a formula book each day that you then use (and expend) as needed. (Also - just in case I need to say it, unlike the rest of the examples that follow, regular wizards absolutely do exist in Eberron and can be played as is with no re-flavoring necessary)</p><p>Want to play an artificer? You can play an alchemist. Instead of mundane concoctions that you infuse each day, you mix doses of powdered Siberys, Eberron and Khyber Dragonshards in different amounts and infused with different strengths of your inherent magical capabilities each day to create the bombs, mutagens and elixirs of an alchemist.</p><p>Want to play an artificer? You can play an inventor. The devices that allow you to Overdrive are magical inventions that you've created, again, powered by your own innate capabilities. Your innovation? Also magical. Literally nothing changes but how you describe it</p><p>Want to play an artificer? You can even play a gunslinger. Rather than pistols or rifles, you have created your very own magical wand or staff that fires beads of force (and this is important - it looks like an actual magic wand or magical staff. It doesn't look like a freaking gun that shoots magic instead of bullets). These implements are powered by magical vials of powdered Siberys Dragonshards that you've invented call Siberys Powder. You infuse each with some of your own magical energy when you craft them, and suddenly bullets are instead magical batteries that power your wand or staff. Instead of purchasing more bullets, you purchase the raw materials and infuse your own vials of Siberys Powder. Mechanically - exactly the same. Cost - exactly same as just buying bullets or black powder or whatever.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":0,"name":"The Siberyan Theory of Magic","type":"text","_id":"F57VPENi69WnhSoU","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>To understand the nature of magic, one first needs to understand that the essences of the three great progenitor dragons comprise the whole of the multiverse. At the dawn of time, the Progenitors - Siberys, Eberron and Khyber wove this essence together and began to form the thirteen planes of existence. As they approached the completion of this first great act of creation, they rested in the space between. No one knows why Khyber betrayed the others, but without warning she attacked Siberys and tore him into countless fragments. The two remaining dragons fought, and gentle Eberron, unable to defeat her sister, transformed herself into a living prison, the world that now bears her name. It is said Khyber lives still below the surface in the hellish Underdark, while Siberys’ broken form is visible in the golden ring which surrounds the land. </p><p>Rather than continuing to frame the understanding of magic as four unique and distinct traditions, with the Arcane, Occult, Primal and Divine existing in self contained spheres, disassociated from each other, one must first understand how Siberys and Eberron imbued all of creation with the four distinct essences of existence: Matter, Mind, Spirit and Life. From Eberron, we get the foundational building blocks of the multiverse itself - Matter and Spirit, the physical and metaphysical, material and immaterial. From Siberys, we get the very magical energies that give those blocks shape and determine how one pursues and understands magic: Mind and Life. Magic arises when an individual focuses the magical energy of their mind or their faith on the physical or metaphysical world.</p><h2>Matter</h2><p>We will start with Matter, or material essence, the most concrete and easiest to understand of the four essences. While students of basic sciences will know that solid objects, liquids, and gases are matter, the essence of matter reflects the energy of fundamental physical forces and reactions such as electricity or combustion. Thus, Matter is not merely earth, water, and air, but fire too, as well as cold (the lack of heat) and chemicals like acid. Material essence is also the namesake of the plane we call home, the Material Plane, but ours isn’t the only plane home to Matter. It’s found everywhere, even in realms mainly built of spirit, and Matter in its purest form can be found on the all planes in the Multiverse. Spells based on Matter are physical energy attacks, such as fireballs and lightning bolts, but also spells of physical transmutation like enlarge and shrink, or physical creation like wall of stone. Thus, it covers much of evocation, transmutation, and conjuration, as well as certain physical abjurations.</p><p>The most important thing to remember about Matter is that it follows physical laws possible to deduce through a scientific process of observation and experimentation. To arcane scholars, that might not seem special, but compared to the other essences, you can’t take that fact as a given! Arcane magic is based upon the idea that we can understand Matter using logic and thought, the classic “Mind over Matter.” Nonetheless, adherents of primal magic have proven that even Matter, the most quantifiable essence, has hidden secrets possible to unlock through faith and holistic understanding. The best research on this juxtaposition comes from the The Guild of Moonlight and Whispers, the first wizard's circle known to exist, founded by Margana Lain, whose members blend arcane and primal magic through the lens of material essence.</p><p>Before we move on, let’s think about what it means for something to lack any connection to Matter. As mentioned, even most planes built mainly of Spirit also contain some amount of Matter. A being without Matter has no physical form and is thus incorporeal, composed of one or more of the other essences (for instance, a wraith is composed of Spirit and the destructive aspects of Life, while an animate dream is composed of Spirit and Mind). What implications does this have? For one, you might otherwise assume that a creature in a gaseous state or made of fire is incorporeal, whether from spells that cause those effects, or because it is naturally an elemental made of air or fire. However, these beings are corporeal, merely from different states of Matter, and those confronting a fire elemental will find magic designed to fight foes with no bodies isn’t particularly helpful. Meanwhile, pure Matter, with no other essences, is just an object, like a chunk of rock, a flow of water, or a breeze of air.</p><h2>Mind</h2><p>Let’s move on to discuss Mind, or mental essence, also known as thought essence or even astral essence among esoteric circles. It’s critical that you don’t overgeneralize Mind to mean “Everything I experience in my consciousness as a thinking being.” All three of the remaining essences (and even Matter, when considering the ability of physical chemicals to alter a mental state) have profound parts to play in your experience of consciousness. But Mind plays a very specific part. This is the energy of knowledge, facts, and your rational mind, including language processing, learning facts, and conscious decision-making. Mental magic is versatile and can be extremely powerful as it assists in gleaning information via divination, building illusions, and even enchanting minds. Not just spells like charm, hypercognition, or illusory image, but a variety of effects from subtle suggestion to obvious dominate. Mind is rarely involved with other schools of magic, but you’ll see it pop up occasionally in mental abjuration effects like mind blank. The transmutation spell haste can either speed up one’s body (mostly Matter) or speed up one’s thoughts (mostly Mind), or both, and is thus available to spellcasters using either Matter or Mind.</p><p>Mind is not simply cold and calculating logic. Intellectual creativity and dreams are built of Mind, along with Spirit. Emotions are among the most difficult parts of our experience to distribute among the essences, and are the subject of great debates as to exactly how they should be assigned. Suffice to say, my best summary is that many of our emotions are complex enough that they are composed of more than one essence, and the most instinctual and subconscious emotions aren’t associated with Mind.</p><p>But what does it mean to lack Mind? To put it simply, if perhaps circularly, it means having no mind, rendering a creature incapable of thought. While this might be more obvious for something like a stone, even living creatures, including most oozes, have no Mind, nor do rudimentary undead like zombies, as the magic creating them isn’t sophisticated enough to steal or build a vessel for mental essence. Mental magic can’t work on such a being, even though it might be capable of performing actions that seem like it has a mind. Generally, these occur either due to instincts built into the creature’s being through life essence (including the perversion that fuels undead), or are preprogrammed by the being’s creator.</p><p>A being composed purely of Mind is not alive, and has no body, instincts, or capacity for growth and change. It’s like a bodiless yet intelligent construct, capable of reason, but not of instinct or growth.</p><h2>Spirit</h2><p>Matter’s metaphysical opposite, Spirit, or spiritual essence, is also known as soul essence or ethereal essence. For most of us on the Material Plane possessed of all four essences, our spiritual building blocks are intangible and invisible, passing through our physical bodies in a way we can feel more easily than see.</p><p>That’s not the case for celestials, fiends, monitors, and other creatures built primarily or wholly from Spirit. Many are fully tangible and manifest physical bodies from the form of Spirit known as quintessence, which might seem counterintuitive to my definition of Matter above. You might be most used to seeing the adjective quintessential, meaning a typical example, but quintessence means “fifth essence” or “fifth element.” It refers to physically manifested Spirit used as building blocks of embodied creatures of Spirit, as well as the Outer Planes such as Daanvi, Kythri, Syrania, and Shavarath.</p><p>Why, when there are four essences, is it named this way? According to elemental scholars, in addition to the elements of air, earth, fire, and water, there is a fifth substance called aether, formed when elemental physicality mixes with the essence of the Ethereal Plane. This leads me to believe aether and quintessence are two words for the concept of Spirit made manifest. Since aether is the basis of force at a distance in effects like telekinesis, this also explains how spiritual magic such as spiritual weapon and spirit blast are associated with metaphysical force (as opposed to physical forces in bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing attacks). Spirit has another physical manifestation in ectoplasm, which occurs when Spirit pushes against the veil of the Material Plane. If quintessence, or aether, is Spirit made manifest like Matter, then ectoplasm is Matter stretched by Spirit, amorphous and only partially solid.</p><p>So, if we’re not a planar being or the Ethereal Plane, what does Spirit do for us? It is the building block of our immortal soul, which carries us to our afterlife as we pass through Dolurrh on our way to whatever waits us on the other side of this mortal veil. It’s strongly connected to the metaphysical alignments of good and evil, law and chaos, much like the Planes themselves. It also carries pieces of those transcendent emotions that can elevate our souls to their highest (such as love) or drag them down to their lowest (such as love, again, but also hatred and despair). Spirit reverberates through you like a breath, and inspires and elevates, so it unsurprisingly is associated with pure inspiration, like the muse that guides a bard or artist. Spirit is not just used for force effects like spiritual weapon or metaphysically aligned spells like divine decree, but also for divinations connecting to the Outer Sphere or beyond, such as read omens, as well as necromancy manipulating spirits or souls, such as resurrection or bind soul. The uplifting and transcendent emotions lead the way to certain enchantment effects, like heroism.</p><p>The most frustrating thing about Spirit is how misused the word is. The vernacular is popular, and most languages lack an analogous word meaning “Being composed only of Life,” so beings composed of other essences are called “spirits” an unfortunate percentage of the time. For example, consider the manifestations of Life that form leshys and guide druids. These are often referred to as “spirits of nature” while not being spirits in the true sense, beings composed of Spirit, at all. I prefer to refer to them as vitae, though using the term vitae to refer to a category of vital-only beings is a bit of a neologism of mine.</p><p>What would a being without Spirit be like? Much as your physical body can change and grow as you age, work your muscles, or gain weight, Spirit allows you to grow metaphysically. That means a being without Spirit can think, reason, have instincts, and even have a metaphysical alignment, but it has no capacity to grow past those and become a fundamentally different person. This has led scholars to deep questions like, “If a being with no Spirit is created with a good alignment, meaning it had no choice but to be good and has no ability to change or choose, is it even actually good?”</p><p>A being of pure Spirit would be a mindless quintessential or ethereal construct, neither alive nor dead, requiring programming from a creator to act. Think of a mindless inevitable aeon and you’re close.</p><h2>Life</h2><p>I’ve saved Life for last not only because it is the hardest for me to write about as an arcane scholar, but also because by its nature it is impossible to teach it fully in a text like this. Nonetheless, I shall try. Life essence, or vital essence as it is often called to make it clear the essence has a destructive side, is the essence presiding over what we call positive energy, the cosmic energy of creation and life, and negative energy, that of destruction and death. It’s tempting to misattribute metaphysical alignments from the Outer Sphere like “good” and “evil” to positive and negative energy, but that would be an attempt to project morality onto amoral forces. Used for their intended purposes, both are part of the way the universe is supposed to work.</p><p>Twisted against their intent, using positive energy to destroy or negative energy to create can lead to unspeakable evil. </p><p>Before we get sucked into a discussion on undead, let’s finish defining vital essence. It’s not so simple as “I’m alive. I have Life.” Life is the counterpart to Mind because it represents the irrational, the instincts ingrained in you from birth as part of your very lifeforce, your faith in the unknown. Here we return to emotions. Our most primal and subconscious emotions and urges are ruled by Life, and that is critical to understanding how we act in ways we might not have wanted to rationally, or in ways we can’t explain. This can lead to sublime epiphanies and expressions of faith, but it has a dangerous side as well: In her provocative text on drug addiction, the world-famous Cyran medic Kassi Aziril postulates that when the three progenitors molded our vital essence to leave a hole to be filled by faith, they accidentally made us susceptible to filling that gap with drugs and other more dangerous addictions.</p><p>The magic of Life is most obviously associated with necromancy, the study of life and death. It’s true that positive and negative energy are strongly tied to Life magic, as are abjurations that protect against them such as death ward. But there’s also an undercurrent associated with instinct and faith, more often found in enchantment, and sometimes even divination. For instance, effects like fear and sometimes charm, a prototypical spell of Mind, can be accessed via the instinctual connections within Life, speaking to base fears and drives, rather than intellectual ones. </p><p>Let’s address undead. If negative energy isn’t evil, why are undead evil? The tragedy of undeath is that it perverts negative energy outside its natural role of destruction and forces it to create. The result is a being with a horrifying emptiness filled only by a connection to that subverted need to destroy, full of instincts and subconscious urges from the corrupted essence that inexorably twist it to evil. This is why ghouls must devour the living’s flesh, vampires need fresh blood, and even incorporeal undead drain Life. Many become evil almost right away, but those with the willpower and virtue to stave it off are still doomed, with time, to change. </p><p>So, what would a creature be if it didn’t have Life at all? It would be neither living, nor undead. Even beings of the afterlife built of spiritual quintessence have vital essence. It would be a construct, albeit an intelligent construct with a soul, able to reason and grow, but with no inherent instincts.</p><p>What about a being of pure Life? Disembodied and acting on instinct? The vitae of nature called upon in commune with nature and that come to embody leshys are the perfect example. Powerful and wise beyond time, they don’t have Mind or Spirit until embodied in a leshy, and thus don’t remember or change in the way that we do.</p><h2>In Conclusion</h2><p>By isolating and understanding the essences, we can build them together and see why and how magic works. </p><p><strong>Arcane magic</strong> is the study of the physical world (<strong>Matter + Mind</strong>), though that doesn’t mean arcane spells can’t occasionally access topics of magic traditionally covered by Life or Spirit through a scientific fashion, such as in the study of necromancy.</p><p><strong>Occult magic</strong> is the study of the metaphysical (<strong>Spirit + Mind</strong>), though sometimes there is an overlap with the other essences, as in the case of object reading, where a material object houses a psychic imprint. </p><p><strong>Primal magic</strong> is faith in the physical and natural world (<strong>Matter + Life</strong>), and among all magics hews closest to those two essences in traditional spellcasting, but creatures such as fey have found ways to exploit the powerful energy of primal magic to create cerebral mental effects. </p><p><strong>Divine magic</strong> is the faith in the metaphysical (<strong>Spirit + Life</strong>), but such faith can still on occasion create or manipulate Matter, or effects of quintessence that seem similar to Matter. </p><p>Thus, a reminder: The world needs magical scholars to continue these studies! Even these fundamentals house contradictions and idiosyncrasies awaiting the next new magical theory. </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"knTUi1bTspduSmIG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ddZ8Oq5qZCKRTwMr"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1670017535214,"modifiedTime":1674934740594,"lastModifiedBy":"knTUi1bTspduSmIG"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"qEQOPMeYxrsMvITF"}

In particular, their abilities allow them to take the form of other humanoid creatures with little limitation on who. Many use their gifts as a form of artistic expression or to convey their current emotional state, adopting certain personas depending on the context of their moods. However, it does not go unnoticed by many, including some changelings themselves, that their ability is an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and those whose aims are to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with general suspicion.</p><p>Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler. Wherever humans live, changelings reside also; the question is whether they make their presence known.</p><p>A persona is known as the faces and personalities each changeling chooses to adopt - based on where changelings are born their personas are likely to vary. A changeling born in an isolated community might only possess one persona that they developed, using a single face as they exist on Khorvaire, while those belonging to a community of changelings will have multiple personas and perhaps come to share them with one another, each being \"Tamirin the Traveling Seamstress\" on different days of the week. </p><h2>You Might…</h2><ul><li>Shift your shape to a persona that matches your mood or current activity. Though you, never use a particular form for too long before moving on to the next.</li><li>Travel light, and keep an eye on the road, never settling down - whether that be a fear of being driven away or simply a restless desire to travel.</li><li>Take a great interest in the people around you, their stories, and their histories. After all, these new learnings might be the basis for one of your future personas.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably…</h2><ul><li>Others assume that because you have the uncanny ability to change their faces at will, that you will use it for malevolent ends, cheating honest folk before moving on.</li><li>Employ you for your ability to shift your shape to any number of forms, whether this is for entertainment, acting, or protection.</li><li>Don't understand the fluid nature you have with gender, form, or personality.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Changelings are typically 5 to 6ft tall, weighing between 120 to 180lbs. Their base form is a nondescript humanoid shape with white skin, hair, and featureless eyes - not unlike a mannequin. Beyond this, because of their ability to shift-shape, changelings do not have a set physical description.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Changeling society is fragmented, and no two groups of changelings have the same culture. However, for changelings that live in areas where other of their kind reside, and often shared feature is a fluidity in concepts of identity, gender, and personality. Changelings that aim to master the form of shapechanging and mimicry tend to treat each persona as a real being, breathing life into reach persona. Some almost eternal figures of local legend, like the vampires lurking in abandoned fortresses, are instead multi-generational efforts of changeling families, all inheriting the persona when they are deemed ready. Is your changeling adventuring to prove they are worthy of inheriting one of these legendary personas?</p><h2>Philosophy and Religion</h2><p>Changelings tend towards pragmatic neutrality, and few changelings embrace evil. As changelings are primarily products of the culture in which they grow, their moral alignment tends to match the alignment of their peers. Similarly, for religion, a changeling might be inclined to follow the dominant faith of their peers.</p><p>However, many changelings find a connection to the Traveler and live a life with less consistency and more chaos - almost as if the god of trickery and change guides them.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>A changeling might use a different name for each mask and persona, and adopt new names as easily as they change faces. The true name of a changeling tends to be simple and monosyllabic. For changelings that share personas with their communities, there are often accents each individual changeling employs that is missed by the single-skins. Two changelings might both play the role of Amel, but one is Amel-with-vivid-blue-eyes and the other is Amel-with-golden-nails.</p><p><strong>Sample Names<br />Changeling Names:</strong> Aunn, Bin, Cas, Dox, Fie, Hars, Jin, Lam, Mas, Nix, Ot, Paik, Ruz, Sim, Toox, Vil, Yug</p><h2>Game Information</h2><h3>Ancestry</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-ancestries.tUOhW7iwigDphydN]{Changeling}</p><h3>Heritages</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.eigb9BQtFlRK6cih]{Changeling Traveler}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.g4MKkF3rxEg7n3Jd]{Hidden Changeling}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.0oWf1bAjyprHLQpr]{Persona Changeling}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.NhIC5RGwzSqI2YD6]{Watchful Changeling}</p><h2>Ancestry Feats</h2><h3>Level 01</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.np2kYjzghVVlSis4]{Camouflage}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.tFVCmz1GaZMPELVj]{Clawed Adaptation}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.TcBhNo4vg5GYAGal]{Eberron Changeling Lore}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.srngc18QSuuObT6J]{Rapid Shift}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.0mxN7fB0kwYh6k5A]{Shapechanger's Intuition}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.FITKT3qY27XhkFWo]{Skin Cant}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.Wbar59DYC4LLJpkp]{The Traveller's Gift}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.IRUCv8Ihl2z9yLt1]{Personable Performer}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.rWawNdypsXN2iatm]{Wellversed Traveller}</p><h3>Level 05</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.mXgxxMGzfpGxZ01d]{Climbing Adaptation}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.YUyIvSqw8HnmMccm]{Deep Shift}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.jva94rAiXrr8oB3R]{Emotional Empaty}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.2NwvQxffrbcmE0BQ]{Skin Glider}</p><h3>Level 09</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.XVvSckARztl1HcR8]{Amorphous}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.gv0RYMUn9Gv415J8]{Aquatic Adaptation}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.h4p2dq98yzMydzIl]{Mind of the Traveller}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.LvwK0tGvqtKcCK9k]{Rapid Regeneration}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.kdhMB39fsmCWeq7B]{Skin Dancer}</p><h3>Level 13</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.zJAkQqOtHcX4JzqB]{Marvelous Mimic}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.pjkiY3yy8grQSum5]{Terrifying Shift}</p><h3>Level 17</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.ZBUGnLaQVtF9X63x]{The Traveller's Protection}</p><hr /><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":150000,"name":"Dwarves","type":"text","_id":"0zz5E5a8envzMN6w","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote style=\"padding-left:var(--space-2xl);width:643.891px\"><p><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Gold is the gift of the mountains, but iron comes from blood and bone. -Mror Proverb </span></p></blockquote><hr style=\"border-top:1px solid var(--color-border-light-primary);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light-highlight)\" /><p>The origin of the dwarves is shrouded in mystery.

Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm belowwhich was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the Mror Holds, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten. </p><h2 style=\"font-weight:normal;font-size:1.5em;border-bottom:0.5px solid var(--color-underline-header);color:#000000;text-align:start\">You Might…</h2><ul style=\"padding-left:var(--space-m);width:643.891px;margin:var(--space-s) auto 0px auto\"><li>Strive to uphold your personal honor, no matter the situation.</li><li>Appreciate quality craftsmanship in all forms and insist upon it for all your gear.</li><li>Don’t waver or back down once you’ve set your mind to something.</li></ul><h2 style=\"font-weight:normal;font-size:1.5em;border-bottom:0.5px solid var(--color-underline-header);color:#000000;text-align:start\">Others Probably…</h2><ul style=\"padding-left:var(--space-m);width:643.891px;margin:var(--space-s) auto 0px auto\"><li>See you as stubborn, though whether they see this as an asset or a detriment changes from one person to the next.</li><li>Assume you are an expert in matters related to stonework, mining, precious metals, and gems.</li><li>Recognize the deep connection you have with your family, heritage, and friends.</li></ul><h2 style=\"font-weight:normal;font-size:1.5em;border-bottom:0.5px solid var(--color-underline-header);color:#000000;text-align:start\">Physical Description</h2><p>Dwarves are similar to humans in many ways though they're shorter (averaging around 4.5 feet (1.4 meters)) and are known to be more enduring.</p><h2 style=\"font-weight:normal;font-size:1.5em;border-bottom:0.5px solid var(--color-underline-header);color:#000000;text-align:start\">Society</h2><h3>Dwarves of the Mror Holds: </h3><p>The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions-strange symbiotic items that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities. Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element of your character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak witch drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan. Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. What prompted you to venture out into the wider world of Khorvaire?</p><h3>Dwarves of the Five Nations: </h3><p>Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes-and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of Sharn or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in Thrane more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time. When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War? </p><h3>Dwarves and Dragonmarks: </h3><p>The Mark of Warding appears on dwarves of House Kundarak, which had its origins as one of the clans of the Mror Holds. Kundarak dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation. In addition to providing all manner of security, House Kundarak dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.</p><h2 style=\"font-weight:normal;font-size:1.5em;border-bottom:0.5px solid var(--color-underline-header);color:#000000;text-align:start\">Philosophy and Religion</h2><p>A large majority of dwarves worship the Sovereign Host, particularly Dol Arrah, Kol Korran and Onatar.</p><h2 style=\"font-weight:normal;font-size:1.5em;border-bottom:0.5px solid var(--color-underline-header);color:#000000;text-align:start\">Names</h2><p>Dwarf names often have strong consonants and several syllables.

When the host of Valenar thunders forth, neither will save you. -Shaeras Vadallia, High King of Valenar</p></blockquote><hr /><p>Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves of the distant continent of Xen'drik rose up against the giants who ruled over them. This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow-assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen'drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.</p><p>Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The drow, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.</p><p>As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship with the past: Do you value the traditions of your ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward? </p><h2>You Might…</h2><ul><li>Revere your ancestors and look to them for guidance</li><li>Adopt specialized or obscure interests simply for the sake of mastering them.</li><li>Have features such as eye color, skin tone, hair, or mannerisms that reflect the environment in which you live.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably…</h2><ul><li>Focus on your appearance, either admiring your grace or treating you as if you're physically fragile.</li><li>Worry that you privately look down on them, or feel like you're condescending and aloof.</li><li>Treat you as an outsider, either as a member of the warlike Valenar or distant and unfamiliar Aereni or Drow</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>While generally taller than humans, elves possess a fragile grace, accentuated by long features and sharply pointed ears. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, featuring large and vibrant-colored pupils that make up the entire visible portion of the eye. These pupils give them an alien look and allow them to see sharply even in very little light.</p><p>Elves gradually adapt to their environment and their companions, and they often take on physical traits reflecting their surroundings. An elf who has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries, for example, might exhibit verdant hair and gnarled fingers, while one who’s lived in a desert might have golden pupils and skin.</p><p>Elves reach physical adulthood around the age of 20, though they aren’t considered to be fully emotionally mature by other elves until closer to the passing of their first century. A typical elf can live to around 600 years old.</p><h2>Society</h2><h3>High Elves: The Aereni</h3><p>For thousands of years, the island nation of Aerenal has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.</p><p>The Aereni are isolationists who have little interest in the world beyond their island. The Five Nations are a place of chaos and war, so why would any sensible elf venture into that madness? As you make an Aereni elf character, decide what has caused you to leave your island home and the protection of the Undying Court in order to wander the world. Are you in search of a power that could earn you your place in the Undying Court? Have you been given a quest by one of your own deathless ancestors? Or are you an exile, banished from your homeland for some crime against your people's rulers? </p><p>Consider your character's personal and family history. What is your family known for, and how can you prove yourself to be a master of these skills? Do you have ancestors in the Undying Court, and if so, what's your relationship with them? Do you find it challenging to deal with the short-lived races, or are you patient with them?</p><h3>Wood Elves - The Tairnadal</h3><p>Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars-against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan-live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.</p><p>The Tairnadal have three distinct lines: the Draleus Tairn, the Silaes Tairn, and the Valaes Tairn. All three lines roam the northern plains of Aerenal, having left the forest long ago, but the Valaes Tairn now reside mostly in Valenar, being the Tairnadal most often encountered in Khorvaire. Despite sharing a homeland with the Aereni, the Tairnadal have distinct religious traditions, revering their patron ancestors rather than the Undying Court.</p><p>In creating a Tairnadal character, including a Valenar elf, think about your patron ancestor. Most Tairnadal pursue the same class as their patron, so if your character is a wizard, your ancestor was likely a legendary archmage. Was your ancestor a famous blademaster, a stealthy hunter, or a war chanter? Were they chivalrous or merciless? Bold or clever? Whatever their path, it is your duty to follow their example. Is this something you proudly embrace, or do you resist it? Do you know another elf with the same patron ancestor, and what's your relationship to that character? Do you know an elf whose patron ancestor was a bitter rival of yours?</p><p>Also consider why you are traveling with a group of player characters (who are presumably not also members of your war band) instead of serving with the Tairnadal. Do you experience visions of your patron ancestor driving you on a particular course? Are you pursuing an epic quest that mirrors your ancestor's legendary deeds? Are you seeking vengeance for the death of a friend or ally? Or have you turned away from your people, either by choice or because of the actions of a rival?</p><h3>Elves of the Five Nations</h3><p>Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there. Many of the finest wizards and most renowned artisans in the Five Nations are high elves. Wood elves are found among the rangers and druids of the Eldeen Reaches and stalking the darkest alleys of Sham.</p><p>As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions of your ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.</p><p>Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?</p><h3>Drow of Xen'drik</h3><p>Long ago on the continent of Xen'drik, the first drow fought beside the giants against the other elves. Tens of thousands of years have passed, and drow and other elves remember each other only as figures in their legends. The Undying Court and the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal remember the drow, but they have little occasion to teach their living descendants about these shadows of the distant past.</p><p>When the elves fled to Aerenal, the drow remained on Xen'drik as subjects of the giants, and they were caught in the collapse of giant civilization. Today they linger on Xen'drik and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence. </p><p>Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across Xen'drik, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld. </p><p>When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?</p><p>How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust. You might have overcome your initial prejudices by the time the campaign begins, or perhaps you're working to build trust with another elf member of your adventuring party.</p><h3>Elves and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The Mark of Shadow first appeared among the elves of the Phiarlan line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from Aerenal to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to House Thuranni. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.</p><p>Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the Mark of Shadow appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Bladesan espionage agency in the service of Aerenal's Sibling Kings </p><h2>Philosophy and Religion</h2><p>The Aerenal elves worship their ancestors as Deathless, lifeforms much like undead but kept alive by the positive energy of Irian. The Deathless serve as advisors and defenders and are considered by those who worship them to be divine as a whole, in the form of the Undying Court.</p><p>Tairnadal elves do not worship the Undying Court. Instead, they follow the Spirits of the Past. By emulating the deeds of these ancestors, they believe the spirits can live again. They do not resurrect their fallen or beloved as Deathless.</p><p>The Drow of Xen'drik don't worship their ancestors directly. Rather, they tend to hold to the preservation of their forebears' traditions. They believe nothing honors their ancestors more than by living as they did. Some Drow also worship the scorpion god Vulkoor, though some Khorvairian scholars suspect Vulkoor to merely be an aspect of The Mockery, a member of the Dark Six.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>When an elf declares herself an adult, usually some time after her hundredth birthday, she also selects a name. Those who knew her as a youngster may or may not continue to call her by her “child name,” and she may or may not care. An elf’s adult name is a unique creation, though it may reflect the names of those she admires or the names of others in her family. In addition, she bears her family name. Family names are combinations of regular Elven words; and some elves traveling among humans translate their names into Common while others use the Elven version.</p><p><strong>Sample Names</strong><br /><strong>Male Names</strong>: Aramil, Aust, Enialis, Heian, Himo, Ivellios, Laucian, Quarion, Soverliss, Thamior, Tharivol.<br /><strong>Female Names</strong>: Anastrianna, Antinua, Drusilia, Felosial, Ielenia, Lia, Mialee, Qillathe, Silaqui, Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia.<br /><strong>Family Names (Common Translations)</strong>: Amastacia (Starflower), Amakiir (Gemflower), Galanodel (Moonwhisper), Holimion (Diamonddew), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Naïlo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel (Moonbrook), Ilphukiir (Gemblossom), Xiloscient (Goldpetal).</p><h2>Game Information</h2><h3>Ancestry</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.ancestries.PgKmsA2aKdbLU6O0]{Elf}</p><h3>Heritages</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.Nd9hdX8rdYyRozw8]{Ancient Elf}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.1dYDucCIaZpCJqBc]{Arctic Elf}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.NfIAGatB1KIzt8G7]{Cavern Elf}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.kiKxnKd7Dfegk9dM]{Desert Elf}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.jEtVesbqYcWGbBYk]{Seer Elf}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.1wVDYY9Wue0G5R9Q]{Whisper Elf}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.nW1gi13E62Feto2w]{Woodland Elf}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.mewiOqN9knYQp8f7]{Mark of Shadow}</p><h2>Ancestry Feats</h2><h3>Level 01</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.eCWQU16hRLfN1KaX]{Ancestral Linguistics}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.WoLh16gyDp8y9WOZ]{Ancestral Longevity}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ng9H9flz4H6agiiV]{Demonbane Warrior}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.yMfZulJcoSomQ6dO]{Elemental Wrath}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.y7Or0CbcQBDdS9yG]{Elven Aloofness}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.zki5qdM5IQcAiscM]{Elven Lore}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.eD3KZJV8ACLt2xns]{Elven Verve}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.4NKyZVkmWjDyyIYZ]{Elven Weapon Familiarity}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.AogIo1gHLdz7DyHx]{Forlorn}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.o4LycqplO14zn6It]{Know Your Own}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.kCO4r8NOm8E2T3eH]{Nimble Elf}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Pat4H0VbmApblZxc]{Otherworldly Magic}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.G8WgbujrrnMQUQ8E]{Share Thoughts}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.uW0VSyy75YrsvtWz]{Unwavering Mien}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.af2fSePLvqMNNp0r]{Wildborn Magic}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Y1bEisU8jVCsIYk3]{Woodcraft}</p><h3>Level 05</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.k8nWKHLYvAKMuwLd]{Ageless Patience}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.scNrNhnGTgPIzoj7]{Ancestral Suspicion}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.5AnJTAZnuWrkL8fa]{Defiance Unto Death}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.4M36jGbeSDfZFM38]{Elven Instincts}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.zc32MIxa1E6357D6]{Elven Weapon Elegance}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.zgriBCYR4TmBoDqO]{Forest Stealth}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.qXl2cOh3wL3QszCy]{Martial Experience}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.3NZSRyoulnzsi3sn]{Wildborn Adept}</p><h3>Level 09</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.8aRa9VHoDKl9B1Z1]{Brightness Seeker}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.aIm2qi4JZerthZmF]{Elf Step}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.vfuHVSuExvtyajkW]{Expert Longevity}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.KgiYiDz1lWoBMRlF]{Otherworldly Acumen}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.LRBzEzpS19z3Eghd]{Sense Thoughts}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.qS2VcFLez4PLOpIS]{Tree Climber (Elf)}</p><h3>Level 13</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.LTcpBbnngfuYTdB0]{Avenge Ally}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.wruf4sMh3P7o8k1P]{Elven Weapon Expertise}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.EiiCCJqWnN5RYMV4]{Universal Longevity}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ne7nVluvvVXMvuB1]{Wandering Heart}</p><h3>Level 17</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.QXZFvsZDduxwTJYM]{Magic Rider}</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Gnolls","type":"text","_id":"9dCJ3OORWktvKaFE","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>Powerfully-built humanoids that resemble hyenas, gnolls are cunning warriors and hunters. Their frightening visage and efficient tactics have given them an ill-starred reputation.</p></blockquote><hr /><p>Gnolls began their existence being bred for and recruited by the overlords of War, Rak Tulkhesh, and the Wild, the Wild Heart. They served as foot soldiers, fighting against orcs, the early humanoids of Khorvaire, as well as the other gnoll clans belonging to opposing overlords. Even after the overlords were bound by the Silver Flame, gnolls continued to act as their pawns.</p><p>This subjugation was broken by a revelation shared between two rival clans of gnolls in the midst of a battle; their fur soaked by blood and wading through limbs and carnage, they questioned what had led them to destroy their kin. The two clans then turned to each other and formed an alliance, urging their brethren to deny the voices that called for endless war and refuse to chase death in the service of any fiend. The two clans coalesced with many more, and those who absolved themselves of servitude took their idols to the Znir - a word that means stone - and destroyed the sculptures of the fiends that kept them bound to violence. All of these clans - warrior, shaman, hunter - vowed that no god, chib, nor demon would hold dominion over them and while their clans differed, they all were of the same pact. These were the ancestors of the Znir Pact gnolls, now found throughout Khorvaire but most prevalently in Droaam.</p><p>There are still gnolls that remained bound to the overlords, lacking the freedom of their Znir kin. Is your Gnoll of the long-standing Znir pack, or have they recently been liberated from the grasp of the overlords, trying to find their way through Khorvaire?</p><h2>You Might…</h2><ul><li>Always try to work smarter, not harder.</li><li>Be very physically demonstrative—often hugging, punching, or licking your friends.</li><li>Keep a bone from a favorite relative to ask for advice.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably…</h2><ul><li>Are intimidated by your size, teeth, and eerie laugh.</li><li>Assume that you are dishonorable or worse.</li><li>Respect the brutal efficiency of your hunting style.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>A typical gnoll stands over seven feet in height, but this is belied by their hunched posture. Males and females are similar in appearance, and other species have difficulty telling them apart. Gnolls have thick fur over their bodies; depending on clan, this can be uniform in colour or broken up with spots or stripes. Their eyes are yellow or green and gleam with reflected light. While these are common traits, the fiendish heritage of gnolls sometimes manifests itself in its appearance. An unusual gnoll could have glowing red eyes, fur with stripes that glow like flames, or other unusual traits. Typically these don’t grant special abilities, though you could attribute a class ability or feat to such a mutation.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The Znir gnolls include a dozen different clans, each of which holds distinct traditions. Once the clans were devoted to different faces of the overlords, but when they shattered their statues, each clan chose one of the moons. All gnolls skillfully hunt and fight, but the Barrakas are known to be the finest trackers of the Pact; the Aryth, the deadliest archers; the Olarune, the strongest warriors and most forceful in the vanguard. Typically, mercenary units are comprised of gnolls of a single clan, assigned based on the nature of the task that lies ahead, and contracts are usually negotiated for a period based on cycles of the clan’s moon.</p><p>The clans maintain distinct territories within the Znir region, but all gnolls are welcome around the hearth of any clan; the Znir take pains to crush any tension that arises between the clans. Shamans and leaders from each clan maintain a council at the Znir, around the idols their ancestors broke. Here they mediate disputes, assign contracts to clans, and allocate funds and equipment. The Eyre clan has honed their skills as smiths and tanners, and they craft much of the equipment used by the Znir gnolls-though there is still a strong tradition of scavenging among the Znir, and warriors often claim trophies from fallen foes.</p><h2>Philosophy and Religion</h2><p>Gnolls have very strong pack instincts, and an unsentimental matter-of-fact approach to life, and prioritize results over methods. [50] They instinctively work together in combat and think nothing of placing themselves in harm’s way to protect their kin. If a gnoll character adopts a group of adventurers as their temporary pack, these things apply to the other characters - but the gnoll will be surprised and angry if their non-gnoll packmates don’t show them the same respect. This means the typical gnoll trends towards a Lawful alignment, but good and evil depend on the current terms of their contract.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>A Gnoll's most important identifier is its whoop. While deceptively short, a whoop includes a range of ultrasonic inflexions that indicate clan, a personal identifier, and a suggestion of family affiliation (the Znir trace lineage through the mother). Because it’s impossible for most non-gnolls to properly replicate a whoop, gnolls also use contract names-names intended to be used with clients and other outsiders. There is a basic structure of contract names used by all gnolls; the inflexion of the name indicates gender, though few people recognize this if they don’t speak Gnoll. The Znir typically attach clan names to a formal introduction: “Ghyrryn Barrakas, Znir.”</p><p><strong>Sample Names:</strong> Dagnyr, Dhyrn, Ghyrryn, Gnasc, Gnoryc, Gnyrn, Gnyrl, Hyrn, Lhoryn, Lhyr, Lhyrl, Mognyr, Myrl, Sorgnyn, Thyrn, Toryc, Yrgnyn, Yrych</p><h2>Game Information</h2><h3>Ancestry</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-ancestries.mUoArD9V8jjvHGDr]{Eberron Gnoll}</p><h3>Heritages</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.UXvIT1uba7cIlHMF]{Aryth Clan}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.GejILt8upCoAnUf9]{Barrakas Clan}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.ChzNEPiPOWGBMS8P]{Dravago Clan}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.xMR0VDFPcRcAN9yI]{Eyre Clan}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.pCVKlCQjtVRO91vl]{Lharvion Clan}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.DvDKegdPwEj9CitN]{Nymm Clan}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.pSqbV1Oh3vHEKdwg]{Olarune Clan}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.jn7uWFxqjzHSpHNw]{Rhaan Clan}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.GOxjUpiDeTLA0YWE]{Sypheros Clan}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.RcUTrMU4A13sVhWv]{Therendor Clan}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.fLWan0IF1iPpyx8S]{Vult Clan}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.LY4PdgmTOnNy7SiB]{Zarantyr Clan}</p><h2>Ancestry Feats</h2><h3>Level 01</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.VpPuNP70ctQkHsaZ]{Gnoll Weapon Familiarity - Eberron}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.8gQJ8MDpdGJRWiVJ]{Aggression}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.gJW9IS9kZBCiyIIN]{Pack Attack}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.fxqWu0oxLldynvJE]{Bone Eater}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.FzpJEd524GzjGvpy]{Znir Lore}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.aOhZUMCn0o2ZMkdW]{Crunch}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.5vipJDU5hGs0SejD]{Hyena Familiar}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.aGpH394T1xr2ey88]{Pack Hunter}</p><h3>Level 05</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.Q0VVIWFyJsT8kOsz]{Distant Cackle - Eberron}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.U0htnfIzCHpQIbDJ]{Gnoll Weapon Practicality - Eberron}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.B99JWovJ6N5l1XVw]{Essence of the Moon}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.C08exRJe5wriImIO]{Survivor}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.0FqbyC5tR2DC0DOk]{Pack Stalker}</p><h3>Level 09</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.MG1u55mUr087KJjH]{Gnoll of Many Tribes}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.A1q8HtTRn6SYNunu]{Intimidating Ferosity}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.NEkCbFcVZMzhjZ9f]{Neither God nor Demon}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.8RsPjTxkfLxk2B4X]{Pack Frenzy}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.7Zvw4Gkx2GXahzG3]{Armored Warrior}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.FZZXgmVMAmvKHWIo]{Breath Like Honey}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.mU8vTzrWX9fIlG0d]{Grandmother's Wisdom}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.QNgnwkKZmJR5jT7K]{Laughing Gnoll}</p><h3>Level 13</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.aZw06Z0qOoPV0Bwk]{Gnoll Weapon Expertise - Eberron}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.Co7O5ZT13lNybJpm]{Moon Presence}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ytgmam8COVq8B7Do]{Ancestor's Rage}</p><h3>Level 17</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.boVx4CsKmEnGTKpn]{Professional Mercenary}</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":178125,"name":"Gnomes","type":"text","_id":"XO4XyDJOD0e8m6iK","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>Long ago, early gnome ancestors emigrated from Thelanis, realm of the fey.

These qualities are further reflected in their physical characteristics, such as spindly limbs, brightly colored hair, and childlike and extremely expressive facial features that further reflect their otherworldly origins.</p></blockquote><hr /><p>Gnomes are among the most inquisitive of races. They seek knowledge in all its forms and tend to careers which allow them to fulfill this thirst: bards, historians, alchemists, and librarians, as well as spies. The gnomes rule the nation of Zilargo, one of the oldest nations of Khorvaire.</p><h2>You Might…</h2><ul><li>Embrace learning and hop from one area of study to another without warning.</li><li>Rush into action before fully taking stock of the entire situation.</li><li>Speak, think, and move quickly, and lose patience with those who can’t keep up.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably…</h2><ul><li>Appreciate your enthusiasm and the energy with which you approach new situations.</li><li>Struggle to understand your motivations or adapt to your rapid changes of direction.</li><li>See you as unpredictable, flighty, unreliable, or even reckless.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Gnomes are one of the smallest humanoid races, even smaller than the halflings.

Their hair can ve almost any color, including white, blonde, brown, orange, or even green. Their eyes are glittering black orbs.</p><p>Gnomes are extremely long-lived, living 300-year lifespans, and start showing their age at 100 years old, with their hair going white and their skin show wrinkles and weathering.</p><h2>Society</h2><h3>Gnomes of Zilargo</h3><p>Zilargo is the gnomish homeland. Lying southeast of Breland in southern Khorvaire. It is situated between Breland on the north and west and the goblinoid nation of Darguun on the east. Zilargo has been effectively independent since 962 YK, and their independence was ratified by the Treaty of Thronehold in 996 YK. Zilargo is the major shipbuilding center in Khorvaire and also produces fine gems from its mines in the Howling Peaks and the Seawall Mountains.</p><h3>Gnomes of Thelanis</h3><p>The gnomes originated on the plane of Thelanis, and a large number of them still reside there. These gnomes are wilder than their Khorvairian counterparts.</p><p>Thelanis gnomes on Eberron mostly reside in Pylas Pyrial, a glittering tower of alabaster and gold. Over the centuries, the Zil have maintained a relationship with Pylas Pyrial when it has appeared. Pylas Pyrial is ruled by the Summer Council, which includes gnomes and eladrin. While the Triumvirate has no formal power within the Gate of Joy, the Trust has infiltrated the feyspire and have agents amongst its ruling council.</p><h3>Gnomes and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The most noted gnomes of Eberron are the gnomes of House Sivis. As with other dragonmarked houses, House Sivis is made up of a number of bloodlines that have continually manifested the Mark of Scribing over the years. There are twelve families in House Sivis, including Corralyn, Haskal, Lyrriman, Magan, Santor, Severin, Syrralan, Tarlian, and Torralyn. House Sivis is responsible for the Notaries Guild and the Speakers Guild, which operate across Khorvaire. Though Sivis enclaves can be found on almost every nation on Khorvaire, House Sivis makes their home in Korranberg.</p><h2>Philosophy and Religion</h2><p>Gnomes have an innate thirst for knowledge, and always ask questions of those around them. Gnomes have made up for their small stature by sharpening their knowledge as a weapon. They often use diplomacy as a tool, but are not above using blackmail or espionage as a tool either. They frequently keep knowledge to themselves, and hide both their truths and their emotions from others. Most gnomes wear a false smile, all the while absorbing information from those around them. Even good gnomes tend to use manipulation of knowledge, and often justify it by using their skills for good rather than for evil.</p><p>Family and clan bonds are immensely important to gnomes, and are the only others that a gnome will trust. A gnome's family will help them out without question, but the expectation of the opposite is held. Clan bonds are not as strong as family bonds, but some clans, like House Sivis, retain a high level of trust amongst clansmen.</p><p>The gnomes hold no one religion over another. Most cities in Zilargo hold a wide variety of temples. Gnomes support the worship of the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, the Church of the Silver Flame, and even Cults of the Dragon Below.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome has three names: their personal name, their family name, and their house name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families within House Lyrris.</p><p>Gnomish names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims “the sweetest song is the name of a friend.” Personal and clan names average three syllables in length, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.</p><p><strong>Sample Names</strong><br /><strong>Male Names</strong>: Alian, Castar, Dorius, Elymar, Haliar, Hasal, Illian, Jassian, Lassius, Sanadal, Tallian, Torius<br /><strong>Female Names</strong>: Alina, Cassia, Dalia, Jandia, Lysse, Myssia, Ranadala, Saralyssa, Talina, Tandria, Tassi, Vassilia<br /><strong>Family Names</strong>: Alyre, Alysse, Canatar, Del, Dorian, Hal, Josilyn, Kan, Lin, Lorridan, Lyrriman, Sil, Suvius, Syrralan, Talius, Til, Torralyn<br /><strong>Clan Names</strong>: Adredar, Clebdecher, Dalian, Davandi, Harlian, Hebberdesh, Korrian, Lonadar, Lyrris, Nezzelech, Santiar, Tarliach</p><h2>Game Information</h2><h3>Ancestry</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.ancestries.CYlfsYLJcBOgqKtD]{Gnome}</p><h3>Heritages</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.XeXWsvcWU3Zaj5WC]{Chameleon Gnome}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.D3hTAqgwSank8OyO]{Fey-Touched Gnome}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.tXC5Gwn9D5x0ouJh]{Sensate Gnome}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.d0bNxgGqvaCkFlhN]{Umbral Gnome}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.ViKRoVgog172r163]{Vivacious Gnome}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.etkuQkjkNLPLnjkA]{Wellspring Gnome}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.zMBjsa5rxsFVoL5u]{Mark of Scribing}</p><h2>Ancestry Feats</h2><h3>Level 01</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ED58GzldWb82yc2q]{Animal Accomplice}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.48X3xSWxI20RPOr9]{Burrow Elocutionist}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.MS53Ds75BT379ZFm]{Empathetic Plea}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.FWCULKnVXhSPL0ST]{Fey Fellowship}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.yJ8Ez5dEscIk1xr5]{First World Magic}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.mxhGH4FVYXJwb0BC]{Gnome Obsession}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ccWf2F5DqiqFwiQ1]{Gnome Polyglot}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.3zr5Gt5LgHsMNpSO]{Gnome Weapon Familiarity}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.zs2FFGI88zB7EaBT]{Grim Insight}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.tFgsBRsEo9ZEA5fU]{Illusion Sense}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.SrSYEHqOLXWuj65e]{Inventive Offensive}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.hSzNtRNwrma81Eeq]{Life-Giving Magic}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ojp39fVYqFBGAw38]{Natural Performer}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.VcnOEAM3UR7oS0D5]{Razzle-Dazzle}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.MXkklchuimVSHZyd]{Theoretical Acumen}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.AgR1OPBHDvwV5wKD]{Unexpected Shift}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.txgCXcNMDe9kO7N8]{Vibrant Display}</p><h3>Level 05</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.evwCimenReYvcruj]{Animal Elocutionist}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.0ihK3qYItmi8eVZs]{Eclectic Obsession}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.NBDwiz1NDioc2eMP]{Energized Font}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.OqJMjuK61uST7AlM]{Gnome Weapon Innovator}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.MwjnRpVn3br88Caj]{Intuitive Illusions}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.HKGyFj2w5dzkf3SW]{Natural Illusionist}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.twnZopGlB392hmqH]{Project Persona}</p><h3>Level 09</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ZPK2Un5ChzeNc9Dx]{Cautious Curiosity}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.WUVNZoIZvr9XFv2x]{First World Adept}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Twhkz2FfzaZezVnG]{Fortuitous Shift}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.aOIZvx5fx5jVHHOO]{Life Leap}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.7vUOlVqjheZV0Nmc]{Vivacious Conduit}</p><h3>Level 13</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.j49fEU2TWJUaxD30]{Gnome Weapon Expertise}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.jatfexNkXaTs9s5Q]{Instinctive Obfuscation}</p><h3>Level 17</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.UKHIKipBvOGhzcSQ]{Homeward Bound}</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":178907,"name":"Goblinoids","type":"text","_id":"rCIuNfWDbMlUNfMD","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>Hoisting the head by the fading plumes of the ruined helmet, still tied under the chin by a cord, Haruuc raised it in one hand and his bloody sword in the other. “Your lord is dead!” he howled in the human language. “The battle is done!

The Goblin language is widespread, especially in the more untamed areas, and is treated as Common by many of the monstrous races.</p><h2>Goblins</h2><h3>You Might…</h3><ul><li>Strive to prove that you have a place among other civilized peoples, perhaps even to yourself.</li><li>Fight tooth and nail—sometimes literally—to protect yourself and your friends from danger.</li><li>Lighten the heavy emotional burdens others carry (and amuse yourself) with antics and pranks.</li></ul><h3>Others Probably…</h3><ul><li>Work to ensure you don’t accidentally (or intentionally) set too many things on fire.</li><li>Assume you can’t—or won’t—read.</li><li>Wonder how you survive given your ancestry’s typical gastronomic choices, reckless behavior, and love of fire.</li></ul><h3>Physical Description</h3><p>Goblins are stumpy humanoids with large bodies, scrawny limbs, and massively oversized heads with large ears and beady red eyes. Their skin ranges from green to gray to blue, and they often bear scars, boils, and rashes. Goblins average 3 feet tall. Most are bald, with little or no body hair. Their jagged teeth fall out and regrow constantly, and their fast metabolism means they eat constantly and nap frequently. Mutations are also more common among goblins than other peoples, and goblins usually view particularly salient mutations as a sign of power or fortune.</p><h2>Hobgoblins</h2><h3>You Might..</h3><ul><li>Seek out the most effective and practical solutions to any problem.</li><li>Encourage a clear chain of command among any group you travel with, following orders even if you disagree with them.</li><li>Look for opportune alliances with other creatures, even if you don’t fully understand or trust them.</li></ul><h3>Others Probably…</h3><ul><li>Consider you dangerous, due to your reputation and intimidating appearance.</li><li>Assume you hate magic and other mystical arts.</li><li>Recognize your incredible endurance, dedication, and discipline.</li></ul><h3>Physical Description</h3><p>Hobgoblins stand nearly as tall as humans, though they tend to have shorter legs and longer arms and torsos. They have the bald, wide heads and beady eyes, and gray skin that becomes steely blue when tanned. Hobgoblins are remarkably hardy; they recover from illnesses quickly and are able to exert themselves for long periods of time with little difficulty.</p><h2>Bugbears</h2><h3>You Might…</h3><ul><li>Present an air of indolence that hides the vicious ferocity you display in battle.</li><li>Use your great strength, long limbs, and endurance to perform feats of athletics that few others are capable of.</li><li>Move slowly and in time with the world around you, listening and waiting until the time is right to expend your energy.</li></ul><h3>Others Probably…</h3><ul><li>Walk and talk cautiously around you, in fear of invoking your ire.</li><li>Look to use your might to their advantage, assuming that you are easily outsmarted.</li><li>Underestimate your silent step - assuming that your great mass could not possibly move as quietly as the stories say.</li></ul><h3>Physical Description</h3><p>Bugbears: These stealthy and strong goblinoid creatures can thrive in the mayhem of battle or move slowly with the world around them - regardless they usually conserve their great reserves of energy until needed. Standing between 6 to 8 feet tall and weighing 250 to 300lbs, bugbears outsize most humanoids that they meet. Bugbears are typically extremely muscular, able to lift and move great weights with their long limbs. They are covered in thick short yellowish fur and share the same pointed ears as their goblinoid cousins. Due to their longer limbs, weapons wielded in the hands of bugbears have a greater reach than typical. </p><h2>Society</h2><p>Goblins, Bugbears and Hobgoblins are present in communities across Khorvaire. The ones that primarily consist of goblinoids are Dhakaan and Darguun. </p><p>Darguun is made up of a patchwork of clans, each clan led by a local warlord. These lords often, but not always, swear fealty to a greater warlord in a quasi feudal relationship, but the warlord holds absolute authority in the lands that they control. The leader of the nation of Darguun is the Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor. Haruuc leads the young and volatile nation through a combination of martial prowess and a deft negotiation with many, but not all of these warlords. The nation is almost unique in Khorvaire as it practices slavery, in direct opposition to the Code of Galifar. Technically, Lhesh Haruuc abolished the practice in the capital of Rhuukan Draal, but each warlord chooses whether to permit slavery with the local clans borders or not.[3] Slaves are treated as cattle in this land with no rights and an ever-present need for more to be delivered or captured. The land is currently united by the warlord Lhesh Haruuc but expected to explode into violence with the death of its current war chief.</p><p>Dhakaani society is bound by the philosophy of mu'ut and atcha, both respectively meaning the duty to one's empire and personal honour. Hobgoblins are the strategists and commanders of the Dhakaani, typically having the skills of fighters, bards, or rangers.. Dhakaani Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the khesh’dar (“silent folk”), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers. The khesh’dar spread agents across the Five Nations, and one can never know when a city goblin might turn out to be an assassin. The martial culture and rigid caste system of Dhakaan places bugbears in roles of aiding with demanding physical labour and being amongst the strongest warriors. See Exploring Eberron (p. 96) for more information on Dhakaani Society.</p><p>Acting as a counterpart to both regions, the druidic goblinoids find an alternative path of life, not abandoning their strengths and stealth, but rather using them to meld into the nature surrounding them. These communities of goblinoids are smaller and less centralized. Often druids, rangers, or wisdom's guide these communities. </p><p>Goblinoids dwell in most of the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblinoids and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins. Galifar ended the practice of slavery, and these goblinoids are now citizens of the Five Nations. Gifted goblinoids can be found in all walks of life, and goblinoids served in the armies of the Five Nations during the Last War.</p><h2>Philosophy and Religion</h2><p>The religion of an individual goblinoids depends on the culture in which they were raised. Goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire do not subscribe to a set religion but share the same spiritual connection to Uul Dhakaan, a dreamlike nation that guides the Empire. Alongside this, Dhakaani venerate historical conquests, their previous leaders and warriors, and their past through story-telling. Instead of clerics, their spirituality is guided by the bardic dirge-singers who commemorate the tales of old and those to come.</p><p>The druidic cultures of the forest-dwelling goblinoids are similar to their Dhakaani kin, wherein there is a higher prevalence of ancestor worship, bardic spiritual leaders, although there is less glorification of military feats in their stories.  </p><p>There is no unifying religion for the goblinoids within Darguun, and the goblinoids found in human communities are more likely to subscribe to the populous' religious beliefs. </p><p>All goblinoids, especially for those of the Dhakaani Empire, lean towards lawful alignments. This can manifest in a tendency towards organization, whether this is found in centralized or decentralized communities. </p><h2>Names</h2><p>Goblinoid names often feature drawn-out vowel sounds (represented by doubled letters), as seen in the names of both their ancient empire (Dhakaan) and their newborn country (Darguun). Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears use the same names and naming conventions, despite their tribal differences.</p><p><strong>Sample Names</strong><br /><strong>Male Names</strong>: Aruget, Chetiin,

Most terrifying thing I've ever seen.</p><p>-Sir Danton ir'Lain, Brelish knigh</p></blockquote><hr /><p>The halflings of Eberron originate from eastern Khorvaire, and many nomadic tribes of halflings still travel the Talenta Plains. The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use. Lightfoot halflings are the more widespread halfling subrace, especially in the Talenta Plains, but stout halflings are found within nearly every halfling community.</p><h2>You Might…</h2><ul><li>Consider your bond with your dinosaur your most important relationship</li><li>Get along well with a wide variety of people and enjoy meeting new friends.</li><li>Find it difficult to resist indulging your curiosity, even when you know it’s going to lead to trouble.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably…</h2><ul><li>Act intrigued and a bit scared by your unusual choice of mounts</li><li>In cities, assume you're part of the Boromar mafia</li><li>Underestimate your strength, endurance, and fighting prowess.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Halflings are short humanoids who look vaguely like smaller humans. They rarely grow to be more than 3 feet in height. Halfling proportions vary, with some looking like shorter adult humans with slightly larger heads and others having proportions closer to those of a human child.</p><p>Most halflings prefer to walk barefoot rather than wearing shoes, and those who do so develop roughly calloused soles on their feet over time. Tufts of thick, often-curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet. Halfling skin tones tend toward rich, tawny shades like amber or oak, and their hair color ranges from a light golden blond to raven black.</p><p>Halflings reach physical adulthood around the age of 20. A typical halfling can live to be around 150 years old.</p><h2>Society</h2><h3>Talenta Halflings</h3><p>The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains. Those few Talenta halflings who journey across Khorvaire are visibly out of place, both attracting curious stares and expressing plenty of curiosity of their own about the strange ways of Khorvaire’s cities and towns.</p><p>As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you’ve remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.</p><p>Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halflings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur-like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs of your home remains strong.</p><h3>Khorvaire Halflings</h3><p>Quick and charming, many halflings put their natural talents to use as bards, barristers, merchants, and politicians throughout Khorvaire. Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.</p><p>Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sharn, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of Stormreach. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you’ve gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point of contact who has made the Boromar Clan your party’s group patron, as described later in this chapter.</p><h3>Halflings and Dragonmarks</h3><p>Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the Mark of Healing in House Jorasco and House Ghallanda’s Mark of Hospitality. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of Aerenal received their first marks — centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of House Ghallanda joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There’s actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.</p><p>With its powers related to food and shelter, the Mark of Hospitality was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows House Ghallanda to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the Mark of Healing has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and House Jorasco still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.</p><h2>Names</h2><p><strong>Sample Names<br />Male Names</strong>: Antal, Boram, Evan, Jamir, Kaleb, Lem, Miro, Sumak.<br /><strong>Female Names</strong>: Anafa, Bellis, Etune, Filiu, Lissa, Marra, Rillka, Sistra, Yamyra.</p><h2>Game Information</h2><h3>Ancestry</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.ancestries.GgZAHbrjnzWOZy2v]{Halfling}</p><h3>Heritages</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.Eq42wZ5OTweJLnLU]{Gutsy Halfling}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.Mj7uHxxVkRUlOFwJ]{Hillock Halfling}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.G9Gwfi8ZIva52uGp]{Jinxed Halfling}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.idGDjqi1q3Ft8bAZ]{Nomadic Halfling}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.Lp7ywxabmm88Gei6]{Observant Halfling}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.cCy8vsZENlwiAyZ6]{Twilight Halfling}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.xtRIYizCjLg9qe1Z]{Wildwood Halfling}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.bTTnbHE2VKwhET51]{Mark of Healing}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.hvcffssnZz5TBWPp]{Mark of Hospitality}</p><h2>Ancestry Feats</h2><h3>Level 01</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Ugw1zZStQhg6iz8h]{Adroit Manipulation}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.vcfeHDoaWEZtEcfz]{Distracting Shadows}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.0YXRPqCaOQ3G73hh]{Folksy Patter} @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.VU07hybqzUXIJ6l2]{Halfling Lore}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ZbRVqf14RTJJIZXG]{Halfling Luck}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.2ebcYbg68pCZfAFQ]{Halfling Weapon Familiarity}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.E1sjYRb4zsZVrzrN]{Innocuous}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.AjdmoGFoSIyx1mxd]{Intuitive Cooperation}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.A9HQ2bMAge2aGgWx]{Prairie Rider}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ehvHedIwPcxq9cRt]{Sure Feet}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.50CRpoP5XS1MVbu8]{Titan Slinger}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.A1RzkLCj7mXJI1IY]{Unassuming Dedication}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.uuD8Z9jUG61GmenX]{Unfettered Halfling}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.zAZJpgeEf5TWvdq4]{Watchful Halfling}</p><h3>Level 05</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Z56DtGBd3AcZOCeG]{Cultural Adaptability}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ZRI1OXaaa4ZC6EK1]{Easily Dismissed}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.jNrpvEqfncdGZPak]{Halfling Ingenuity}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.9WsYVbe47aSADs1Q]{Halfling Weapon Trickster}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.f5Vkk2rM6tCe2zQn]{Shared Luck (Halfling)}</p><h3>Level 09</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.swsMURQBMXZpjWl8]{Cunning Climber}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.O9z1MJpEaf6Y1Acd]{Dance Underfoot}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.qr1E37Tla555tvIO]{Fade Away}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.k0sXAn4PPq5nW9al]{Guiding Luck}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.gWyCNTWUhxneOBne]{Helpful Halfling}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.cRMUYCnkkE9lSEhh]{Irrepressible (Halfling)}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.RFXzsfEgz7WbDCQO]{Unhampered Passage}</p><h3>Level 13</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.PfHvTR0L9ShjhWiP]{Ceaseless Shadows}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.MII0ybm76DkDxsId]{Cobble Dancer}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.gsW6mCMBWquLM3bj]{Halfling Weapon Expertise}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.iTsLr3zEaGZ45zez]{Incredible Luck (Halfling)}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.l78KwojlT0AWvS4l]{Toppling Dance}</p><h3>Level 17</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.7YvOqcdp9Z0RALMp]{Shadow Self}</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":125000,"name":"Humans","type":"text","_id":"E5DJSa0gyemWSdBZ","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>Dwarves are stoic. Elves are wise. Gnomes are  cunning. And humans? They can’t make up their mind, so they try to be all of these things at once.</p><p>— Kessler, bard of Sharn</p></blockquote><hr /><p>Humans’ ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the Khorvaire's predominant ancestry. Their nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the entire world, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p><p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p><h2>You Might…</h2><ul><li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li><li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li><li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably…</h2><ul><li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li><li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li><li>Aren’t sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived. Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The first human settlers came to Khorvaire about 3,000 years ago, landing in the area now known as the Lhazaar Principalities. From there, they began a slow but inexorable spread across the continent, disrupting the placid elven empire of Aerenal and leaving further ruined remnants of fallen Dhakaani goblin kingdoms in their wake. During this migration, they founded the settlements that would grow into the Five Nations. Even today humans make up the majority of the population in these countries. Despite their relatively short lifespans — or perhaps because of them — humans are innovative, adaptable, and aggressive, always pushing their limits and pursuing new ideas.</p><p>Humans prove extremely diverse; a barbarian from the Demon Wastes has little in common with a Brelish rogue. When creating a human character, consider where you’re from and how that’s reflected in your class and background. Chapter 2 presents an overview of the nations of Khorvaire and ideas for characters tied to those lands. Aundair is a logical place of origin for a wizard character, but your wizard could be a down-and-out arcanist from the alleys of Sharn or a Lhazaar pirate with a knack for the mystic arts.</p><h3>Humans and Dragonmarks</h3><p>Four different dragonmarks appear among humans, reflecting their dominant status among the races of Khorvaire:</p><ul><li>The Mark of Making is found in House Cannith, which has used it to become one of the most powerful houses, creating an abundance of both magical and technological wonders.</li><li>The Mark of Passage aids the humans of House Orien in operating the lightning rail and trade caravans running across the continent.</li><li>The Mark of Sentinel makes the bodyguards, mercenaries, and Sentinel Marshals of House Deneith widely respected across Khorvaire.</li><li>The Mark of Handling appears in House Vadalis, which uses it to breed fine mounts and other creatures.</li></ul><h2>Philosophy and Religion</h2><p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Most folk carry a common surname, either a family name or a name related to their region of origin or job. Sorn Fellhorn, Kara of Windshire, and Tellan Magewright are all examples of naming conventions among the common folk of the Five Nations. Those born outside the Five Nations may follow this convention, or may not carry a name other than their given name.</p><p>The royal families that trace their roots to the original kings and nobles of the Five Nations, as well as those granted land and titles in more recent times, add an ir’ in front of their surname. So, Queen Aurala of Aundair carries the name of Galifar’s kings, ir’Wynarn, while a vassal lord identifies himself as Lord Darro ir’Lain. This practice extends to the Mror Holds and Zilargo, where some dwarf and gnome families were granted titles by the Galifar rulers.</p><p>In a practice that predates Galifar and was introduced after the War of the Mark, those born of the blood of the dragonmarked houses add a d’ to their surnames. Merrix d’Cannith, Orum d’Kundarak, and Elsen d’Medani are all blood members of the dragonmarked houses.</p><h3>Aundairan Names</h3><p>Aundairian names follow the Galifaran tradition of a personal name

are born with a bond to an otherworldly being. They have memories of lives never lived, visions of combat with fiends that they never fought, and the sense of an endless struggle against darkness. For all the pain and suffering in the world, the Kalashtar know that there is a path to light. Some faceless enemies would hunt all the Kalashtar down and would see their bloodlines eradicated. The Kalashtar's path to light is a dangerous one, as death awaits in the shadows.</p></blockquote><hr /><p>The Kalashtar, throughout Khorvaire, are viewed as deeply spiritual people with an other-worldly quality that is hard for many to place. This alien nature is a result of what the Kalashtar are; creatures born from the willing union between humans and quori spirits from the Plane of Dreams, Dal Quor. These Quori spirits are born of the periodic cycles of Dal Quor - which alternate between Light and Dark. As each cycle comes to an end, it is destroyed and reborn as the other. The current phase of Dal Quor is darkness, it is that of il-Lashtavar - also known as the Dreaming Dark. The quori of the Dreaming Dark rule Dal Quor and aim to extend their cycle forever and block out the light to come. However, centuries ago, a handful of quori spirits rejected these machinations and fled from Dal Quor.</p><p>Sixty-seven of these rebel spirits escaped into Eberron and found sanctuary in the minds and bodies of Sarlonan monks. These monks are the ancestors of the modern-day Kalashtar. The quori spirits live through the bloodlines of their first hosts, inherited through generations. By maintaining these bloodlines, the mere existence of the Kalashtar is a protest to the evil of the Dreaming Dark and its goals. However, the Dreaming Dark seeks to extinguish these rebel spirits. If they succeed, and a bloodline is terminated, it means the loss of the spirit, and its return into Dal Quor to be reborn and moulded to the Dreaming Dark.</p><p>While most kalashtar quori are one of the original sixty-seven escaped spirits, it is possible for a Kalashtar to join with a Quori spirit who recently abandoned the Dreaming Dark.</p><p>As a result of their bonds to their Quori spirit, Kalashtar experience the world differently than other creatures. Their bonded nature enables an aptitude for psionics and greater resistance against psionic attacks. Not only this, but the Kalashtar have an ability to greater influence the emotional domain of their once fiendish quori.</p><p>The quori represent concepts of nightmares - pride, rage, aggression, deceit - and these concepts were once the source of their power, before turning away from the Dreaming Dark. Now embedded into a Kalashtar, the quori provide their host with a greater understanding of what these emotions are. Coupled with their psionics, Kalashtar can influence the emotional states of their enemies, allies, or even themselves, temporarily. While aptitude in using these skills might vary between Kalashtar, all have the ability to develop and grow their powers through rigorous training and meditation.</p><p>Though the Kalashtar are bonded with their Quori, they cannot speak to their quori directly – instead, the relationship is experienced as a sense of inspiration and instinct. Some Kalashtar experience the presence of their quori in the way they feel some emotions more intensely than others; other Kalashtar find they can inspire those around them to feel or fight back against fear, cruelty, or malice.</p><p>One of the unique results of the quori flight from Dal Quor is that both the Kalashtar and their Quori spirit are unable to return to Dal Quor when they sleep. Instead, Kalashtar experience a trance state shared with their Quori. This trance enables them to relive moments belonging to the ancestors of their Kalashtar line, and even the memories of their quori before it bonded. The adage of the wise Kalashtar often comes from the fact that in their singular life they hold the experiences of many more.</p><p>Throughout the centuries, the machinations of the Dreaming Dark have not yielded, and the evil spirits of Dal Quor still aim to dampen the coming of the Light. For this reason, agents of the Dreaming Dark exist in Khorvaire to eradicate the lineages housing the escaped quori. On the continent of Sarlonna, the Dreaming Dark has taken hostage humans and pose as Inspired, spiritual guides that now lead the Riedran nation. Not all Kalashtar characters are aware of the Dreaming Dark and its connection to Sarlona, but the Dreaming Dark hunts for them all the same. </p><h2>You Might…</h2><ul><li>Aim to understand the emotions of those around you, even if the situation doesn't call for it.</li><li>Very rarely consider the limitations you may encounter as you draw up your goals and aspirations.</li><li>Believe that the rules of reality can be bent like those in dreams.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably…</h2><ul><li>Think you're human, though you move and act in a slightly otherworldly way.</li><li>Find themselves drawn to the wisdom you display, which seems beyond your years.</li><li>Opening their emotions to you, even before they realize they are doing so.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. Beyond this, most creatures struggle to tell Kalshtar and Humans apart at a glance.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>There are three main kalashtar societies.</p><h3>The Adaran Kalashtar</h3><p>These Kalashtar live lives most similar to the first monks that opened their arms to the refugee quori spirits. They still live on the continent Sarlona, but belong to the land of Adar. The Empire of Riedra, ruled by agents of the Dreaming Dark, currently dominates Sarlona, and imperial forces endlessly siege Adar. The monks and priests of Adar believe that the war against the Inspired and the Dreaming Dark won’t be won with weapons; instead, prayer and guided meditation will ultimately shift the balance from darkness to light. They believe the Age of Light will come to Dal Quor, and through their passive actions, they sustain their quori and protect it from returning to the Dreaming Dark. Adaran kalashtar rarely take direct action without reason. They are also ascetic, disciplined, and focused on the Path of Light. They are taught to inspire those who live in fear and enlighten those lost to darkness.</p><h3>The Khorvairian Kalashtar</h3><p>These individuals exist in communities of several major cities of the Five Nations, including the Overlook district in Sharn and Whitewalls in Fairhaven. They prefer to stay close to one another, both to practice their shared traditions and to stand together against any threats posed by the Dreaming Dark. They are familiar with the Path of Light and other kalashtar customs, but there’s no Riedran army at the gates; they know the Dreaming Dark is a threat, but it’s a ghost in the shadows. These kalashtar believe that the Age of Light will be supported through their daily actions, such as showing kindness and compassion or mediating disputes.</p><h3>The Shadow Watchers</h3><p>On the other hand, some of the kalashtar of Khorvaire have embraced a grim path in the battle against darkness. The Shadow Watchers don’t believe that evil can be fought merely with kindness and prayer. Members of this order seek to identify sources of corruption and ruthlessly eliminate them. They believe the Age of Light will come when the Darkness is defeated. As such, a Shadow Watcher’s focus is typically on agents of the Dreaming Dark, although they can pursue any force of evil, supernatural or otherwise.</p><p>However, your kalashtar might not belong to a community with others of their kind at all. An orphaned kalashtar without spiritual guidance might not be able to understand their trances, the way their quori influences their emotions or the manifestations of their psionic abilities. If your Kalashtar does not know fully what they are, what is their relationship with their unique abilities?</p><h2>Philosophy and Religion</h2><p>All quori spirits that inhabit the Kalashtar were born of the Dreaming Dark – they represent nightmare qualities, those of rage, deceit, and pride. However, this does not lend Kalashtar to fall easily into evil alignments. These connections can instead result in Kalashtar gaining a greater sense of empathy: understanding the pains of fear, the hubris of pride, and the folly of deceit.</p><p>Kalashar, just like the humans they originated from, can have an evil alignment. However, those raised with an understanding of their quori tend to develop positive relationships with the darkness their spirit may represent. However lofty their goals are, they will achieve their motivations in any number of ways, so neither law nor chaos has strong sway over the kalashtar.

You humans come from Sarlona. Elves are from Aerenal. Me? I’m a true child of Khorvaire.</p><p>— Nandon Tam, Khoravar activist</p></blockquote><hr /><p>From the Towering Woods of the Eldeen Reaches to the slums of Sharn, half-elves are found across Khorvaire. New half-elves are born in every generation from pairings between humans, elves, and other half-elves, with children typically clinging to a parent’s culture. Over centuries, though, half-elves have developed their own communities and traditions, giving them an identity strengthened by the rise of House Lyrandar and House Medani. Members of these communities generally dislike the term “half-elf,” instead calling themselves Khoravar, an Elvish term meaning “children of Khorvaire.”</p><p>The elves of Aerenal have never allowed a half-elf into the Undying Court, and the Valenar elves don’t consider half-elves capable of channeling a Valenar ancestral spirit. Among humans, though, half-elves don’t experience any more prejudice or bias than members of other races, and some half-elves could easily be mistaken for human. </p><h2>You Might…</h2><ul><li>Feel a connection to other Khoravar and the broader Khoravar community on Khorvaire and seek to do your part to help your fellow half-elves and advance Khorovar society</li><li>Have strong ties to either House Medani or House Lyrandar</li><li>Struggle to feel a sense of acceptance with any particular, should you be the (rare) offspring of a human an elf.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably…</h2><ul><li>Mistake you for a human at times</li><li>If they are Khoravar, expect hospitality and assistance from you as a matter of course</li><li>Assume you are either closely tied to one of the two khoravar dragonmarked houses or are a loner</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Though they might be mistaken for humans at times, in general, khoravar look like elves to humans, and look like humans to elves. In height, they’re on par with both, though they’re neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women. Khoravar men do have facial hair, and occasionally grow beards. Half-elven coloration and features lie somewhere between their human and elf ancestors, and thus show a variety even more pronounced than that found among either other race. They tend to have the eyes resembling their elven ancestry.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The culture that has developed among Khorvaire’s native half-elves places a strong emphasis on hospitality toward other Khoravar. They don’t expect each other to put themselves in danger for strangers’ sake, but when possible, half-elves do what they can to help others with information, shelter, and the like. Khoravar communities have weekly unity dinners where local news and events are shared; these meals are a great chance to hear about local events and opportunities.</p><p>Many Khoravar espouse the idea of “the bridge between,” the notion that the Khoravar are called to facilitate communication and cooperation between members of different cultures or species. Khoravar who follow this philosophy often become bards, diplomats, mediators, or translators. Others are fascinated by their distant connection to the fey and seek to build bridges between the Material Plane and the Feywild of Thelanis. These Khoravar often become Greensinger druids or warlocks with Archfey patrons.</p><p>Khoravar speak both Common and Elvish, and among themselves they often blend these two together. This pidgin makes perfect sense to anyone who speaks both languages, but someone who speaks only one of them will miss some words and subtlety of meaning.</p><h3>Khoravar and Dragonmarks</h3><p>Two dragonmarks appear among half-elf families: the Mark of Detection is found in House Medani and the Mark of Storm in House Lyrandar. Both houses were established families among the Khoravar by the time their dragonmarks appeared, and they remain pillars of the Khoravar’s diverse culture. The Khoravar ideal of building bridges supports the work of both houses. With the Mark of Storm, House Lyrandar operates sailing ships and flying vessels, as well as bringing rain to farmlands. House Medani uses the Mark of Detection to offer services of personal protection.</p><h2>Philosophy and Religion</h2><p>Khoravar usually worship the Sovereign Host, though those in Thrane often demonstrate fervent devotion to the Silver Flame. A few dabble in ancestor worship to emulate their elf heritage, but these are rare individuals. Of these, some have even taken up with the Valenar elves to help that new nation develop.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Khoravar names derive from both human and elven origin, but they have developed into something completely separate from their cultural origins.</p><p><strong>Sample Names<br />Male Names:</strong> Arimart, Enilam, Ivello, Sovelom, Tham, Thariv<br /><strong>Female Names:</strong> Drusila, Fellise, Leleen, Mia, Solloene, Xanaph</p><h2>Game Information</h2><h3>Ancestry</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.ancestries.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX]{Human}</p><h3>Heritages</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.N36ZR4lh9eCazDaN]{Half-Elf}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.ngFtXXA3YRghg2HL]{Mark of Detection}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.uo52Pvo8D3kgdHoR]{Mark of Storm}</p><h2>Ancestry Feats</h2><h3>Level 01</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.nfERPRCITBp970HO]{Earned Glory}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.7BVl9lFf0wuTjBgM]{Elf Atavism}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ecJms2jtd6cZ5rQK]{Round Ears}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.tn7K5lbnF87rZ659]{Sociable}</p><h3>Level 05</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.pqezW5dqha1I32Ld]{Inspire Imitation}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Rr7GdUjXhGhV04Pe]{Supernatural Charm}</p><h3>Level 09</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.8ukixWL8MBJOhPbW]{Pinch Time}</p><p>Additionally - Half-Elves can take ancestry feats from both the Human and Elf ancestries as well.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":189844,"name":"Kobolds","type":"text","_id":"2Md61lJ3JLZlnI2c","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>The black-scaled sorcerer barked a harsh Draconic syllable and a wave of invisible force slammed Daine against the wall, pinning him against the rough stone. His captor sneered, needle teeth flashing.</p><p>\"Thinking to walk the deep tunnels alone and unseen,\" the kobold sneered. \"Khyber whispers and warns, and so you are found. Dead now, by his hand.\"</p><p>Daine gasped in pain as the mystical bonds grew tighter, squeezing the breath from his lungs . . . .</p></blockquote><hr /><p>The kobolds of Khorvaire trace their history to the dawn of Eberron. According to ancient legend, kobolds were formed from the drops of blood shed in the battle between Eberron, Siberys, and Khyber. A new generation of dragons descended from Siberys, Khyber brought forth fiends and horrors, and Eberron gave birth to the creatures of nature -- but the kobolds were already there, spawned from the first battle. True or not, this myth is the driving force behind kobold psychology and culture.</p><p>Two subraces of kobold exist in Khorvaire: the iredar (Draconic for \"ones of earth\"), who trace their ancestry to Eberron, and the irvhir (Draconic for \"ones below\") that descend from Khyber. These two races share a common appearance, but each race has a distinctive body odor that kobolds can instantly detect; in fact, a kobold can automatically identify the subrace of any other kobold within 15 feet. Kobolds find the scent of others of their kind to be soothing, and kobolds that spend long periods of time away from their own kind often become depressed.</p><p>Beyond scent, the key distinction between the kobold subraces is supernatural. Kobolds produce a surprising number of sorcerers, which is a phenomenon they attribute to their supposed bond to the progenitor dragons. Irvhir sorcerers typically possess spells tied to corruption and darkness, while iredar sorcerers usually have powers of defense and binding. This is not an absolute rule, and there certainly exist sorcerers within each subtype that don't align to these generalities. However, an iredar kobold that makes use of spells such as fear, darkness, or chilling touch may be viewed with suspicion by her companions, who see these as the powers of the Dragon Below.</p><p>Outsiders often assume that kobolds are primitive and savage since they live in unmodified caverns and rely on oral tradition instead of written records. Also, they live in small tribal communities and have never come together to create cities, nations, or empires. However, kobolds are just as sophisticated as humans or gnomes. While they prefer to live in natural environments instead of creating artificial structures, kobolds have a great gift for mining and stoneworking, and they often fill their lairs with cunning traps. But their culture is driven by tradition, and the kobolds have never sought to change or progress. They are the children of the dragons, vessels of the progenitors' will; change will come when the great dragons mandate it. </p><h2>You Might..</h2><ul><li>Take pride in your draconic connections, whether you believe dragons are your ancestors or simply patrons.</li><li>Analyze your surroundings, always looking for ambushes, advantageous terrain, and escape routes.</li><li>Naturally observe, adopt, and respect group dynamics, whether as leader, subordinate, or equal.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably…</h2><ul><li>Assume that you are cowardly and won't stick around in the face of danger.</li><li>Appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness, especially when it comes to building defenses.</li><li>Consider your claims of draconic power to be overblown, delusional, or endearing.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Kobolds are short (about 3 feet tall) reptilian humanoids with slender bodies and long tails. They often boast distant draconic ancestry, and every kobold displays one or more draconic features, such as stout horns, razor-sharp teeth, or—more rarely—vestigial wings or draconic breath. They mature quickly, reaching adulthood by about 12 years and living to about 60.</p><p>The color of a kobold's scales can vary widely. Most often, they mimic the hues of chromatic or metallic dragons, with a mix of slightly darker or lighter scales that create a mottled appearance. The scales of newly hatched kobolds often reflect the community's draconic exemplar, whether that's the dragon they currently serve or the dragon type from which they're descended.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The kobolds of Eberron prefer to live in natural caverns. The irvhir kobolds make their homes deep beneath the surface, while the iredar kobolds usually live in mountain caves. The kobolds believe that these caverns are the veins of the progenitor dragons, and they often carve elaborate draconic designs on the walls. Kobolds prefer to live in tribes containing approximately 100 adults. The largest communities can have up to 600 adults. Generally, though, a community splits once its population rises too far above 100 adults, with younger kobolds moving away to found a new community.</p><p>Most kobolds prefer to avoid contact with the outside world. Irvhir kobolds are especially xenophobic, and the miners of Zilargo have been fighting irvhir kobolds for centuries. Iredar kobolds are more moderate in their views. They have little interest in foreign cultures and fight irvhir kobolds as often as they battle gnomes or humans.</p><p>In the wake of the Last War, kobolds have had more active presence on the surface of Khorvaire. Kobold scavengers often rummage through battlefields and ruined villages. Previously unknown irvhir communities have risen from the depths to strike at weakened thorps and hamlets along the borders of the Mournland. Whether these are random attacks of opportunity or driven by the seers of Khyber remains to be seen.</p><p>Kobold culture revolves around three forces.</p><ul><li>Stonescales (or ternmolik, in Draconic) perform the day-to-day tasks required for the survival of a community: crafts, agriculture, and the gathering of food when agriculture will not suffice.</li><li>Claws (gix) are soldiers and hunters.</li><li>Blood Seers (iejirastrix) are mystics who hear the voices of the progenitor dragons -- sorcerers, druids, witches and oracles whose magical powers are seen as proof of the kobolds' divine ancestry.</li></ul><p>Typically the chieftain of a village is an old claw, though in a peaceful region a stonescale can hold the post. The chieftain manages the daily affairs of the community while the blood seers link the communities together. Seers often travel from village to village to meet with other blood seers, discussing their visions and issues affecting the race as a whole.</p><p>One other force that has an impact on kobold culture: the Chamber. While most dragons dismiss the kobold's claims of draconic ancestry, kobold blood seers can have strange (though often distorted) insights into the Draconic Prophecy, and the Chamber occasionally makes use of kobold agents. This can result in teams of kobolds equipped with powerful magic weapons and items -- an unpleasant surprise for a group of adventurers that underestimates the little reptiles.</p><h2>Philosophy and Religion</h2><p>Mainstream kobold culture is oriented around the worship of a particular progenitor dragon. The irvhir tradition is one of the oldest cults of the Dragon Below, though it has no connection with the aberration-oriented cults of the Shadow Marches. The iredar kobolds revere Eberron as the source of life and nature; this is a unique druidic tradition with no ties to the sects of the Eldeen Reaches.</p><p>The kobolds see themselves as the hands of the progenitors in the modern age. And in the past, visions of the blood seers have often been tied to the Draconic Prophecy. It is a mystery, since the kobolds themselves rarely understand the significance of their actions -- but even the Chamber respects this uncanny gift.</p><p>Of course, not all kobolds are bound to these beliefs. A few tribes have split off from these traditions, ignoring the words of the blood seers. Irvhir kobolds often turn to the worship of the Shadow or the Mockery, while independent iredar revere Boldrei and Olladra.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>A young kobold's given name is rarely more than a syllable or two. However, as they age, achieve status, and accomplish great deeds, kobolds add more syllables to their names, imitating a common draconic practice. Kobolds rarely have surnames except in an effort to better fit into a community, in which case they typically adopt the surname of an inspiring figure in that group.</p><p><strong>Sample Names<br />Kobold Names:</strong> Azrnak, Draahzin, Enga, Fazgyn, Fazij, Jekkajak, Kib, Kirrok, Mirkol, Tarka, Urkak, Varshez, Vroklan, Zekstikah, Zgaz</p><h2>Game Information</h2><h3>Ancestry</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.ancestries.7oQxL6wgsokD3QXG]{Kobold}</p><h3>Heritages</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.5A1wMPdzN1OWE4cY]{Caveclimber Kobold}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.35k2aujXYvqUCSS1]{Cavern Kobold}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.P8BP1un5BTrwXoBy]{Dragonscaled Kobold}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.VRyX00OuPGsJSurM]{Spellscale Kobold}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.WaCn0mcivFv1omNK]{Strongjaw Kobold}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.ZW8GX14n3ZGievK1]{Tunnelflood Kobold}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.m9rrlchS10xHFA2G]{Venomtail Kobold}</p><h2>Ancestry Feats</h2><h3>Level 01</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.WoKiYMCXV27szBdy]{Cringe}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.HauCZuLvIthFe2we]{Draconic Sycophant}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.SPyvwsiSghySIEw2]{Dragon's Presence}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.PPUNMjRLQYnmwQvF]{Kobold Breath}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.IElFaS5i10MFYIvq]{Kobold Lore}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.OTjRxyCtwPoqNFP2]{Kobold Weapon Familiarity}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.xzpMQ2ZRn9zC23XG]{Scamper}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.TW5TY7kSf50uaX71]{Slither}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.eMmdBpbMrpIuGowo]{Snare Setter}</p><h3>Level 05</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.j0mlvJcuYGFuMG2S]{Ally's Shelter}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.gS9FYlD0Vt8yyZkP]{Grovel}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.VNmmHrMAVk3Tiw1d]{Kobold Weapon Innovator}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.8DIzXO1YpsU3DpJw]{Snare Genius}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.juLtvliSzYPCmMa3]{Winglets}</p><h3>Level 09</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.zL6zUrt44tZYyuh4]{Between The Scales}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.xM8IWff5yfbQGk4s]{Briar Battler}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.lbiFj4At5BxotaNY]{Dracomancer}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.BaVO8UU5ZkL8OZZj]{Dragon's Breath}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.4EgueMqUm0ebKV4J]{Dragonblood Paragon}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.nqDhQdkgsnvebUMr]{Snare Commando}</p><h3>Level 13</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.I9cJYC7anz7HmpcJ]{Elite Dracomancer}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.kBnsLuh3eBLjwGpN]{Hatchling Flight}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.j0fgquODHTyyekyO]{Kobold Weapon Expertise}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.QjHZN1uAxl2hSbej]{Vicious Snares}</p><h3>Level 17</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.hNr4OrMdCMhQLbtB]{Wyrmling Flight}</p><hr /><p> </p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Lizardfolk","type":"text","_id":"2olcI1oo32TPo8IY","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>With a cultural heritage stretching back to the Age of Demons, the lizardfolk of the Cold Sun Federation have a long history of fighting against darkness and demonic influence that is largely lost on the settlers of New Galifar. Colloquially known as \"Scales\", the Cold Sun Federation tribes are written off as savages due to their preference for natural weaponry and simple weapons.</p><p>While most settlers of Q'barra would assume the Cold Sun tribes have a spiritual tradition of shamanism and druidism, they are actually religiously devoted to a force of inner light, that drives away the darkness. Versed scholars will recognize that this is a form of worship of the Silver Flame, one that most likely predates the institution of the Church of the Silver Flame in Flamekeep by several million years.</p></blockquote><hr /><p>Only a fool looks at the lizardfolk and sees nothing more than scaly humanoids. Their physical shape notwithstanding, lizardfolk have more in common with iguanas or dragons than they do with humans, dwarves, or elves. Lizardfolk possess an alien and inscrutable mindset, their desires and thoughts driven by a different set of basic principles than those of warm-blooded creatures. Their dismal swamp homes used to lie hundreds of miles from the nearest human settlement, but the gap between their way of thinking and that of the smooth-skins is far greater. The encroachment of the humans on the jungles of Q'barra has forced the lizardfolk, despite their alien outlook, to make an effort to understand and, in their own manner, befriend people of other races. The lizardfolk of the Cold Sun Federation make faithful and skilled allies and deadly enemies. </p><p>The lizardfolk remember the dawn of time when dragons soared in the skies overhead and all was in order. Then the sun’s warmth faded. As it turned into a dark orb hanging in the sky, their kin grew cruel and savage. Masvirik, the Cold Sun, pulled on the minds of the lizardfolk, pitting them against each other. Vicious fiends boasted of their power, sacrificing rainbow-winged serpents—the couatl— on obsidian altars. Before long, those winged serpents who escaped sacrifice arrived with a host of dragons, clashing with the fiends in the skies above the jungles. The couatl cleansed the festering corruption of Masvirik, and the lizardfolk joined them in the battle against their fiendish oppressors.</p><p>When victory was in sight, the couatl joined together, dissolving their bodies to form a pure silver flame to bind the Cold Sun beneath his volcano. This binding also captured the dreams of the lizardfolk. For tens of thousands of years, the lizardfolk have been dreaming the same shared dreams: lessons of the past woven together with prophecies and wisdom of the couatl. The lizardfolk of today literally remember the battles of dragon and demon and, as such, can never forget the evil that they stand against. Their dreams teach them of the dusk shards and their duty to ensure that the bound fiends never escape.</p><p>As untold years passed, the lizardfolk anchored themselves to the past through their nightly dreams. Though others came and went, settling the land temporarily before being washed away by the sands of time, the lizardfolk did not record their presence—the dangers of Masvirik and the ancient past are all that matter to them. These fleeting empires might have divided the lizardfolk temporarily, but the lizardfolk knew that territorial conflict risked too much. Thus, they chose to simply exist around the temporary kingdoms.</p><p>In time, a Q'barran empire grew farther than before, but rather than displaying strength it invited disaster. The warmth of the sun faded as the draconic guardians of the ancient city fell to Masvirik’s corruption. Masvirik’s corruption spread, capturing the hearts and minds of dragonborn, lizardfolk, and kobolds alike. Troglodytes emerged from the shadows to serve their master and progenitor.</p><p>However, the couatl foresaw this, and a web of light spread across the land, infusing the dragonshards with the power of the Silver Flame to create the dawn shards. Warmth returned to the sky, and the lizardfolk fought back, working with their dragonborn allies to rebind the escaped fiends and contain the Poison Dusk.</p><p>Today, the lizardfolk see disaster looming once again. At first, the softskinned settlers were just another group of colonizers, living on the land before eventually being consumed by the jungle—another era of ruins for future colonizers to explore. Then, a decade ago, half-orcs with strange magic (House Tharashk) began to collect the dragonshards and grind them up, weakening the web of light created by the dawn shards and freeing fiendish spirits from the dusk shards.</p><p>The half-orcs brought with them not only many more settlers but also great machines to trawl the earth, harvesting the dragonshards in numbers the lizardfolk had never imagined. For many tribes, there was only one explanation—the softskins were eager and willing servants of Masvirik and must be driven from Q’barra at any cost.</p><h2>You Might…</h2><ul><li>Lack an understanding or familiarity with the emotional states of others</li><li>Demonstrate extreme patience, even when pressured to act.</li><li>Feel a much greater connection to your fellow tribesman, via your shared dreams, than outsiders could possibly imagine.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably…</h2><ul><li>Find your demeanor cold or distant.</li><li>Mistakenly view you and your kind as just another type of humanoid, like elves or dwarves, but with scales. Nothing could be further from the truth.</li><li>Act hesitant or intimidated around you, once they begin to more fully comprehend your alien (to them) mindset.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Lizardfolk vary depending on their environment, but share toothy snouts and long and powerful tails. Those from temperate or desert regions tend toward gray, green, or brown scales that aid in camouflage, while those from tropical climes are brightly colored. Many sport dorsal spikes or garish neck frills that hint at their clan lineage. Lizardfolk reach physical adulthood at age 15 and live up to 120 years. The average lizardfolk stands 6 to 7 feet tall, but grows throughout their lifetime, gaining strength and size with age.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>The oldest government in Khorvaire, the Cold Sun Federation consists of a mix of nomadic and settled peoples. The federation does not have a central government, instead they convene a council of tribal leaders whenever a particularly troublesome development arises, a rare occurrence as significant internal conflict and dissent is almost inconceivable due to their shared dreams.</p><p>The Cold Sun tribes are led by members who consider themselves a first amongst equals, placing their people's needs before their own in servant leadership. As such, leadership does not carry many privileges; instead, it is marked by responsibilities. Here, the relative simplicity of their lives is an advantage, as—in sharp contrast to the prospectors drawn to the region—they do not yearn for endless resources and wealth.</p><h2>Philosophy and Religion</h2><p>The lizardfolk’s reptilian nature comes through not only in their appearance, but also in how they think and act. Lizardfolk experience a more limited emotional life than other humanoids. Like most reptiles, their feelings largely revolve around fear, aggression, and pleasure. Lacking any internal emotional reactions, lizardfolk behave in a distant manner. They don’t mourn fallen comrades or rage against their enemies. They simply observe and react as a situation warrants.</p><p>Lizardfolk experience most feelings as detached descriptions of creatures and situations. They see emotions as traits assigned to other creatures, objects, and situations. A lizardfolk doesn’t think, “I’m scared.” Instead, aggressive, stronger creatures register to the lizardfolk as fearsome beings to be avoided if possible. If such creatures attack, lizardfolk flee, fighting only if cornered. Lizardfolk aren’t scared of a troll; instead, they understand that a troll is a fearsome, dangerous creature and react accordingly.</p><p>Lizardfolk never become angry in the way others do, but they act with aggression toward creatures that they could defeat in a fight and that can’t be dealt with in some other manner. They are aggressive toward prey they want to eat, creatures that want to harm them, and so on. Part of this includes the humans who are seeking to remove the dragonshards from the ground of Q'barra; while the lizardfolk do not fully understand the extent of the power of these dragonshards, they understand that the dragonshards keep a great and ancient evil at bay.</p><p>The lizardfolk of Q’barra follow a mix of couatl-inspired and even older primal ideologies. The importance of the sun for warmth and life plays a central point in both, as Masvirik’s defining feature is stealing the warmth from the light. Lizardfolk spellcasters wield both divine and primal magic in combat against the Poison Dusk and to guide their tribes. </p><p>Almost all lizardfolk villages have a pit full of dusk shards, which colonists generally see as some kind of holy collection. While the colonists are not completely wrong— the dusk shards are kept in pits for religious reasons—it is not out of any holy reverence. Rather, the lizardfolk collect dusk shards to keep them out of enemy hands, ensuring that the fiends trapped in the shards remain there. House Tharashk has been eyeing these dusk shard pits greedily, unaware of the terrible consequences that would be unleashed if they were to grind the dusk shards into residuum.</p><p>Nominally, the lizardfolk of Q’barra speak Draconic, although perhaps with a less polished tone than what is taught to the wizards of Arcanix. But while a wizard with the comprehend languages spell can easily understand the literal meaning of what the lizardfolk are saying, the actual meaning is enshrouded in metaphor and reference. The lizardfolk’s language has spent eons developing around references to their shared dreams, rendering them unintelligible to other groups.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Lizardfolk names come from their ancient derivation of draconic and tend to be traditional. Names are typically chosen by the clan's tribal leaders the shared dreams experienced by the tribe during the time surrounding an eggs hatching, though occasionally one's parents may name a hatchling for an ancestor or a beloved historical hero.</p><p><strong>Sample Names<br />Lizardfolk Names:</strong> Arasheg, Barashk, Essaru, Enshuk, Gishkim, Hazi, Inishish, Kutak, Nasha, Shulkuru, Tizkar, Utakish, Zelkekek</p><h2>Game Information</h2><h3>Ancestry</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.ancestries.HWEgF7Gmoq55VhTL]{Lizardfolk}</p><h3>Heritages</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.OoUqJJB77VfWbWRM]{Cliffscale Lizardfolk}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.sEnMG5zbnXdJvVPz]{Cloudleaper Lizardfolk}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.6rIIsZg3tOyIU3g3]{Frilled Lizardfolk}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.6xxXtgj3fcCi53lt]{Sandstrider Lizardfolk}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.VYfpTUuXJM3iBOz0]{Unseen Lizardfolk}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.dJeiekfqGQ8dkwsO]{Wetlander Lizardfolk}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.TQFE10VFvh9wb8zb]{Woodstalker Lizardfolk}</p><h2>Ancestry Feats</h2><h3>Level 01</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.fLDhS0e6fBDjiCUA]{Bone Magic}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.NySPRgD0FjZY2QGs]{Consult The Stars}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.qzalwa2Ze3dIqIrA]{Lightning Tongue}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.FhCsnHjdIUyKteCM]{Lizardfolk Lore}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.itjTPh76mZfJCBxQ]{Marsh Runner}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.U12Sh43QuY85Prdm]{Parthenogenic Hatchling}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.VatkAzfBYjA6z6OP]{Razor Claws}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.k31sg0xBIwvkfWyg]{Reptile Rider}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.GEvaoKgQteMrd4ub]{Reptile Speaker}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.6oJ1EdANHgYCfCeF]{Sharp Fangs}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.LLQ5SO2c44uXDFJk]{Tail Whip}</p><h3>Level 05</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.IY86Kvopp4ACuQsw]{Envenom Fangs}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.VLCAFIXzUtiv1VuE]{Flexible Tail}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.kGed3uQbZ7x5SBB8]{Gecko's Grip}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.s1swBWSqtfrXTJHK]{Guided By The Stars}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.yqtaAZR9jfen6gEW]{Iruxi Glide}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.5iULRBRDOryuWX6t]{Iruxi Unarmed Cunning}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.t3IzY8uSyFj3aGmh]{Shed Tail}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.iliy0ONIb8Hw6muA]{Swift Swimmer}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.y0Ru2hRmoRwkRsxZ]{Tongue Disarm}</p><h3>Level 09</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.B53sWzd5irAoLn2U]{Bone Caller}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.AGznaQpn2cE6jz9H]{Dangle}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.DhqsKns2SaGcOKO9]{Read The Stars}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.FrzskqwNWexKY5BA]{Terrain Advantage}</p><h3>Level 13</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.X1SPiYJqWzqwzPTs]{Primal Rampage}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.pivX2SxPQjKDyvHU]{Iruxi Spirit Strike}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.XuL3g2ExgadFtWbb]{Bone Investiture}</p><h3>Level 17</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.IOlvpmeIwlk0IACr]{Bone Rider}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.wFtJlamwRc6rSQmj]{Scion Transformation}</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":194922,"name":"Orcs and Half-Orcs","type":"text","_id":"Ew5wROvdjx2BBibt","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>We are hunters in a world of sheep.</p><p>— Kalaash’arna, Tharashk inquisitive</p></blockquote><hr /><p>Thousands of years before humans came to Khorvaire, the land was dominated by wild orcs and goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire. The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon’s teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.</p><p>Three prominent groups of orcs have survived into the present age:</p><ul><li>The Ghaash’kala are servants of the Silver Flame (which they call Kalok Shash, the “binding flame”), who devote their lives to battling the fiends of the Demon Wastes. Humans from the Carrion Tribes of the wastes sometimes hear the call of Kalok Shash and join the Ghaash’kala, leading to a significant population of half-orcs there.</li><li>The Jhorash’tar orcs are a perpetual threat in and around the Ironroot Mountains, shaped by their resentment of the Mror dwarves who drove them underground. These orcs are isolated from humans, so half-orcs here are rare.</li><li>The Shadow Marches holds the largest numbers of orcs and the most significant population of half-orcs.</li></ul><h2>You Might…</h2><ul><li>Make the most of your size and strength, either physically or socially.</li><li>Enjoy the wilds of the world and feel uncomfortable in more civilized lands.</li><li>View dying in glorious combat as preferable to a mundane death from old age or illness.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably…</h2><ul><li>Mistakenly see you as violent or lacking in discipline.</li><li>Get out of your way and back down rather than face your anger.</li><li>Underestimate your intellect, cunning, and knowledge.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Orcs are tall and powerfully built, with long arms and stocky legs. Many orcs top 7 feet in height, though they tend to adopt broad, almost bow-legged stances and slouch forward at the shoulders. The combination makes for a seeming contradiction, sharing an eye level with most humanoids while simultaneously towering over them. Orcs have rough skin, thick bones, and rock-hard muscles, making them suited to war and other physically demanding tasks. Despite the roughness of their skin, orcs scar easily, and most orcs take great pride in the scars they have accumulated. Orc skin color is typically green and occasionally gray, though some orcs have other skin colors that reflect adaptations to their environments.</p><p>Orcs consider powerful builds and heavily scarred skin attractive, regardless of gender. A powerful orc makes the hold stronger, and scars are signs of victories won or hardships survived. Similarly, many orcs consider large, jutting tusks to be more attractive than smaller tusks, since the former make more effective weapons. Many orcs also find tattoos to be attractive, particularly large or painful ones that cover a significant amount of skin.</p><h2>Society</h2><h3>Orcs of the Shadow Marches</h3><p>The orc Gatekeepers played a crucial role in defeating the daelkyr and binding their evil in Khyber, and their descendants continue to maintain the ancient seals and fight aberrations spawned by the daelkyr’s corruption. However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. Orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the Shadow Marches, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.</p><p>Humans settled in the Shadow Marches long ago, and the first half-orcs helped to cement the bond between these outsiders and the native orcs. Certain Marcher clans contain humans, orcs, and half-orcs in roughly equal numbers.</p><h3>Orcs of the Ghaash'kala</h3><p>Not all who dwell in The Demon Wastes serve evil. Some are opposed to it, championing the cause of good to keep the Demon Wastes from spilling beyond its borders. Foremost of these agents of good are the Ghaash’kala—predominantly orc tribes that settled in the Labyrinth ages ago. They follow a faith dedicated to Kalok Shash, the Binding Flame—a spiritual force that bears remarkable similarities to the Silver Flame.</p><p>Ghaash’kala roughly translates as “ghost guardians” in the Orc tongue. The Ghaash’kala guardians believe they have a sacred duty to prevent evil from leaving the Demon Wastes. Primarily orcs mingled with a handful of humans and half-orcs, the Ghaash’kala clan members are fierce but not bloodthirsty by nature. They act to keep travelers from entering the Wastes, preferring to convince with words before drawing weapons. On the other hand, they consider anything that emerges from the Wastes—whether wild beasts, barbarians, or travelers returning from an expedition—to be hopelessly tainted, and they strike against such creatures without warning or mercy.</p><p>The Ghaash’kala consist of four clans—the Jaasakah, the Kastar, the Maruk, and the Vaanka. Orcs founded the clans, but attrition over the centuries has forced them to welcome others into their tribal groups. Half-orcs, humans, and even a few tieflings can be found among the Ghaash’kala tribes.</p><h3>Orcs of Khorvaire</h3><p>With the rise of the dragonmarked House Tharashk, orcs and half-orcs have spread through the Five Nations and beyond. In general, the people of the Five Nations know little about half-orcs. When people imagine a half-orc, they usually think of a Tharashk bounty hunter or dogged inquisitive, but a few ignorant sorts might still hold the stereotype of a “simpleton from the swamps.”</p><h3>Orcs and Dragonmarks</h3><p>The Mark of Finding appears among half-orcs of House Tharashk. Strangely, orcs and humans associated with the house cannot develop this mark. Dragonmarked half-orcs work extensively with humans, orcs, and unmarked half-orcs in pursuit of the house’s mission of bounty hunting, inquisitive work, and prospecting. Across Khorvaire, anyone who wants to find something or someone turns to House Tharashk.</p><h2>Philosophy and Religion</h2><p>Orcs are a very primal race. They’re extremely passionate and emotional; this can manifest as aggression or rage, but it’s just as strong when it comes to loyalty, affection and faith. They believe in things intensely. This led to them being the first druids on Khorvaire, the Gatekeepers, and having one of the oldest sects of the Silver Flame, the Ghaash’kala guardians of the Demon Wastes. But they’re also highly individualistic, leaning more towards chaos than law. They are very effective in small tribes or family groups, where they all know each other and are working together, but they aren’t good with faceless authority, blind obedience, or being part of a huge infrastructure. This is one of the main reasons the orcs never dominated Khorvaire. They are barbarians by nature. They have no innate desire to build vast cities or organize huge armies; the small tribe is what they are comfortable with. This led to their being pushed into the fringes of Khorvaire by the Dhakaani goblins, and that’s where this linger to this day. If the goblins are like ants or wasps, orcs are like wolves: fierce, loyal to their pack, but not inclined to form into a massive legion of wolves and conquer the world.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>This is the summation of many of the orc species found throughout western and south-western Khorvaire. While half-orcs may fall into this, they take the name of the community in which they were raised. Tribes may be from almost anywhere in wester Khorvaire to include the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, the Eldeen Reaches, and Droaam. They have a wide variety of traditions for names depending on the influences around them.</p><h3>Orcs</h3><p>Full-blooded orcs often have complicated names that sound like a repeated monosyllabic rhyme, followed by their tribe or totem. Orc names are rife with hard consonants heavy vowels and spitting when they are pronounced.</p><h3>Half-Orcs</h3><p>Half-orcs have a variety of names. Those raised in human communities take human names typically. Those from orcish communities take orcish names. Those who live the half-blood tribes follow the naming convention of the region they're in. Those who bear the tainted blood and live in the Demon Wastes are called Sakah and they wear names of vile meaning like a cloak of skins.</p><h3>Shadow Marches and Droaam</h3><p>Those tribes from the Shadow Marches typically bear names in line with the mannerisms of the orc tribes, such as repeating monosyllables and hard consonants. But the infusion of human blood over the generations has given many of them to take on names similar to the hardy Aundairan and Brelish settlers who survived the trek through the Byeshk mountains or through Droaam to settle there.</p><h3>Demon Wastes</h3><p>Any creature that survives to adulthood there is likely to have some kind of taint on it. Whether this be from eating corrupted food, exposure to the vile winds and sands or blasphemous magic, nothing lives there long without being touched by it. Even the very names of those who live there bear demonic origins and it is unusual to find a being from there who does not carry a moniker of his or her patron. Those who bear tainted blood from their heritage are called Sakah, and are very nearly required to have some sort of vile name given by a prophet of their patron. Foul creatures, their evil names carry power unto themselves as they are often named in the vile speech of the Rakshasa Rajahs. Such speech takes a sound similar to Indian origins with many interruptive consonants and softer vowels intermixed with strange juxtapositions of consonants.</p><h3>Ghaash'kalah</h3><p>Worshippers of the Binding Flame, Kalok Shosh, those few tribesmen who live in the blasted Demon Wastes yet cling to light and life with tenacity are the hardiest of souls. They take their names from the old ways of the orcish shamans but infuse it with a dose of their hard-bitten religion. Most of their names follow the style of the orcs and half-orc tribes of the Shadow Marches but their monikers inevitably reflect their devotion to the Binding Flame, the destruction of evil, and their family ties--in that order.</p><h2>Orc Game Information</h2><h3>Ancestry</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.ancestries.lSGWXjcbOa6O5fTx]{Orc}</p><h3>Heritages</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.8Gsa8KFsHizEwSHU]{Badlands Orc}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.nXQxlmjH24Eb8h2Q]{Battle-Ready Orc}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.wn4EbYk1QN3tyFhh]{Deep Orc}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.VvEAFoxuddYNBmNc]{Grave Orc}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.MTTU2t7x6TjvUDnE]{Hold-Scarred Orc}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.dwKCwwtWetvPmJks]{Rainfall Orc}@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.pZ1u2ScWrBXSaAqQ]{Winter Orc}</p><h2>Ancestry Feats</h2><h3>Level 01</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.wtTye8OrC9cuK7YP]{Beast Trainer}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.JP5pptkl1Fx1JK4m]{Iron Fists}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.PlhPpdwIV0rIAJ8K]{Orc Ferocity}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.254C4rqrE8APDfCf]{Orc Lore}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.EFhh3AenX7wtAmrs]{Orc Superstition}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.1HsH8hE79MDsi8kK]{Orc Warmask}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.M5195FvfCN3X7gi9]{Tusks (Orc)}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.M5195FvfCN3X7gi9]{Tusks (Orc)}</p><h3>Level 05</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Wwr8VilSybQgVtin]{Athletic Might}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.JvTSfyCkG70bmY7f]{Bloody Blows}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.OXhrwQgnZdOi81Yi]{Defy Death}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ehPnY1PuPK7EXkYc]{Demonblood Frenzy}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.aQNsD2t0Tb4vToA4]{Hold Mark}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.RrtqD8WmoUumauJD]{Mask Of Power}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.vxE9hBKB6F2ctOX3]{Mask Of Rejection}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Y3IUIsopvN13vEvZ]{Orc Weapon Carnage}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.z2z3UTayfUhcGazv]{Scar-Thick Skin}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.YeVDITJplindA27l]{Victorious Vigor}</p><h3>Level 09</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ZcKW5n7F0oAqRw5o]{Death's Drums}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.WSxHCapuTn8uRdLI]{Dragon Grip}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ByqxxJkJiNFtjghh]{Mask Of Pain}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.VphmK5JRR35SyEhV]{Pervasive Superstition}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.zZOycr00XDVTKuXa]{Undying Ferocity}</p><h3>Level 13</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.wteuGNhOXLvBudRQ]{Ferocious Beasts}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.GELhS1k0vHEi1PK3]{Incredible Ferocity}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Ih85PWZSVTwU0xkI]{Lifeblood's Call}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.KboQgBhYXI2WdCt8]{Mask Of Fear}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.g6M5mapOXVf0g9BG]{Orc Weapon Expertise}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.pedHIDAVLFzzjGO1]{Spell Devourer}</p><h3>Level 17</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.9eaUS0jJCpxuNXO5]{Rampaging Ferocity}</p><h2>Half-Orc Game Information</h2><h3>Ancestry</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.ancestries.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX]{Human}</p><h3>Heritages</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.heritages.tLd8Qg82AwEbbmgX]{Half-Orc}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.2Qky6m9kD2IeMPzm]{Mark of Finding}</p><h2>Ancestry Feats</h2><h3>Level 01</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.ZZzgqFTOtUgnzSLZ]{Monstrous Peacemaker}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.SCgqIo8VQZZKZ1Ws]{Orc Sight}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.KuD4Yplwcdolhjsu]{Overlooked Mastermind}@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.wAeI18wyWVwfUrIP]{Tusks (Half-Orc)}</p><p>You also have access to all orc and human ancestry feats</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":700000,"name":"Shifters","type":"text","_id":"v2jleQ01uZdCPzZo","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<blockquote><p>Shifters are an ancestry with many similarities to the werecreatures of Eberron. While shifters cannot completely change like werecreatures, they can shift to take on the features of their beast within. From their beast within a shifter gains extraordinary abilities, such as deadly fangs, refined senses, speed, and other similar traits.</p></blockquote><hr /><p>Shifters are a diverse ancestry that combines the traits of humanoid and beast heritage, not unlike a were-creature. At a young age, each shifter discovers their beast within, which comes to define who they are as a person. With the ability to draw on their inherent beast to temporarily shift into a more animalistic version of themselves, they are sometimes also referred to as the were-touched. While some believe shifters are the descendants of werecreatures, the opposite is true. The first werecreatures to plague Khorvaire are said to be shifters who were cursed with great evil. Shifters are unrelated to modern werecreatures and are a distinct ancestry of Eberron with unique cultures and traditions.</p><p>Despite the distinction between shifters and werecreatures, shifters were persecuted during the fifty-year crusade against werecreatures less than two centuries ago. Targeted by the crusaders who fought against the rising lycanthrope tide, many innocent shifters were killed in the crusade to eliminate the threat. Since then, most shifters across Khorvaire prefer to live in enclaves or districts of other shifters - avoiding other ancestries which may still bear them ill will. </p><h2>You Might…</h2><ul><li>Prefer the companionship of other shifters or a close group of friends.</li><li>Feel strong emotions, typically manifesting in the spirit of your beast within.</li><li>View survival as a challenge, and strive to be self-reliant, adaptable, and resourceful.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably…</h2><ul><li>Assume that you have a natural connection to animals and the natural world. Especially that of your beast within. </li><li>Worry that you can't control yourself and may give in to your feral instincts to attack others, especially when the moon is full. </li><li>Have difficulty relating to the strong emotions you can feel.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Shifters are humanoid in shape, but their ancestry gives shifters a distinctly lithe form compared to humans. While travelling, shifters tend to move in springs and leaps rather than simply walking alongside their humanoid companions. Their faces and bodies typically show traits of their beast within, such as longer fangs, pointed ears, feline eyes, and other such features. Their bodies -especially their legs and forearms -are typically covered in more hair than a human, creating a fur-like covering over their limbs. </p><p>A shifter's stance is typically upright with their weight placed on only the front of their clawed feet, creating a semi-digitigrade look. </p><p>A Shifters' beast within is more obvious when they are transformed into their hybrid shape, their features shifting to resemble the animal to which they are connected. The manifestation of these features varies from shifter to shifter, but typically, their teeth become more prominent, their skin toughens like hide, their hair lengthens, and their eyes reshape.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Shifters are a relatively uncommon race in the Five Nations, there are more changelings in Breland than there are shifters. Yet, the shifters who live throughout Khorvaire have formed tight-knit communities. There are two primary types of shifter communities. The first type of community is a nomadic tribal hunter-gather pack, common in the remote woods of the Eldeen Reaches. The other is common in urban centres where shifters form small enclaves to hold on to their traditions and remain with those who understand their ways.</p><p>The communities of the deep forests of the Eldeen Reaches are typically formed out of a desire to be free of the control of nations and other ancestries. These communities are frequently nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes and are primarily composed of shifters. While it is not unheard of to have other ancestries present in a tribe, shifters typically tend to prefer to bond with fellow shifters. Here the culture and traditions of the shifter communities are strongest, as the shifter community cooperates for the good of one another and the survival of the community. </p><p>Shifter communities of the enclaves of major cities typically form as a result of shifters desire to hold on to their culture and traditions. As the minority in many of these urban regions, without these tight-knit groups shifters struggle to hold on to the culture and traditions of their upbringing.  </p><p>While the shifter parents are dedicated to raising their children, the family structure is different from many other ancestries. Shifter children typically form a strong bond with a few other children around their age group. Though the children in these groups are typically from many different families, this initial bond is often the strongest bond that a shifter forms in their life. </p><h2>Philosophy and Religion</h2><p>Shifters are typically neutral and view the world as a struggle to survive. The moral and ethical concerns of a shifter are typically centered around the well-being of those directly around them. However, shifters are as varied in alignment as they are in the animals that they draw ancestry from, and can be inclined to any alignment. </p><p>After the silver crusade, shifters have become suspicious of any outside religion. Having seen how religion can motivate people, they view intense or conflict-prone religions as terrifying forces capable of causing great harm. As a result, shifters' religions are typically varied and less intense than many would expect of their culture.  </p><p>Many shifters follow some form of druidic worship. The most common druidic worship of shifters is that of the order of druids known as the moonspeakers. These moonspeakers draw meaning from the movements of the moons and believe that the moon's influence over their heritage gives the moons great power over shifters. </p><p>Other shifters who reside in the major cities of Khorvaire have taken up worship of the local religion. Many shifters in the urban centres of Khorvaire revere Balinor and Boldrei of the Sovereign Host, and many shifter adventurers revere the ways of the Traveller of the Dark Six. </p><p>During the silver purge, some shifters adopted the faith of the Silver Flame and participated in the crusade. There are still shifters active in the church of the silver flame, though to much scorn of other shifters.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Shifters typically take on names similar to that of humans, or that of the community around them though with a more rustic inclination. Shifters typically have a personal name that they use with their friends and a wandering name that they use with strangers.</p><p><strong>Sample Names</strong><br />Aethelwulf, Bennin, Bree, Burch, Dominic, Erylis, Geth, Karmos, Lorelai, Lyndra, Taria, Volante </p><p><strong>Sample Wandering Names</strong><br />Ash, Aurora, Autumn, Brook, Claw, Cliff, Dawn, Flint, Frost, Hazel, Iris, Lily, Rain,

from the instant they were constructed, until the moment they were deployed, warforged were invented and born for war. As the war came to an end, warforged were recognized and granted their rights as humanoids by the Treaty of Thronehold. Now, they are soldiers whose only purpose has come to an end and must find meaning in a world that has abandoned them.</p></blockquote><hr /><p>Warforged were created as expendable construct soldiers to fight in the last war. Early Cannith development of the warforged war focused on the production of warforged such as the warforged titans which were true constructs - machines of war built to destroy, kill, and die on command. With further refinements and arcane experimentation, the warforged evolved until they were a new type of creature - a living construct. This advancement in development was made possible by the creation forges but came with the side-effect of adding sentience to the new construct known only as warforged. However, with their single-minded focus and combat prowess, sentience empowered warforged with a desire to preserve themselves than Cannith's other mindless constructs exhibit - making them a more efficient soldier than simple golems.</p><p>In the wake of the Last War, the Treaty of Thronehold has granted warforged their rights and freedom from being used as bought-and-sold soldiers of nations. This newfound freedom for warforged is a double-edged sword, as many warforged struggle to find a place in a world that no longer cares for them. Some warforged have taken up new employments as labourers and artisans; many warforged have taken on employment doing what they already know and fight fiercely as a soldier. The warforged that fight on have taken roles as guards, mercenaries, adventurers, and some have found their way back into the employment of armies. Warforged in these roles make steadfast allies and fearsome enemies. They fight with a vigour that most humanoids struggle to match - but with the ability to adapt and learn that mindless constructs can not replicate. </p><h2>You Might…</h2><ul><li>Have scars and wounds from fighting in the last war, dealing with old injuries and trauma that has never healed</li><li>Often misread other creatures' emotions, struggling to understand their - and your own - feelings</li><li>Apply wartime thinking to every situation, analyzing every situation as a tactical puzzle</li></ul><h2>Others Probably…</h2><ul><li>Believe you do not experience emotions and are incapable of higher thinking beyond your programming</li><li>Are an expendable asset, and to be taken advantage of for your tireless nature and lack of world experience outside the war</li><li>See you as a valuable ally to have on the battlefield, even if sometimes they struggle to relate to you</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Warforged appear to be a completely constructed creature. Their frame is composed of a composite of materials—obsidian, iron, stone, darkwood, silver, and organic material. Around a warforged's frame is a musculature is composed of root-like cords infused with alchemical liquids that grant strength and surprising grace and flexibility to their body. Their exterior is covered in a series of flexible metallic or leather plates, creating a form of integrated armor which grants them protection on the battlefield. This integrated armor is attached directly into their body by the root-like tendrils of their musculature and is extremely painful to remove. Most warforged share a similar facial structure, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. The specific composition and structure of each warforged changes depending on their intended purpose, but all warforged are humanoid in shape.</p><p>Unique among constructs, warforged have learned to modify their bodies through magic and training. These unique changes that warforged choose helps define their personality and differentiate their physical form from one warforged from another.</p><p>As constructs, warforged typically don't need to breathe, eat, or sleep; however, the body of a warforged needs to vent alchemical impurities at a constant rate. This venting process requires breathable air to prevent a buildup of impurities in a warforged's alchemical fluids which can seize a warforged's biological components, sometimes to fatal effect. Thus, warforged can still suffocate much like living creatures, but can in a limited sense hold their breath as other humanoid creatures can. Though they don't sleep, warforged require a period of restoration to allow the alchemical fluids of their body to replenish. Without this process, a warforged is incapable of fully restoring their body and they enter an inefficient state (similar to a humanoid who doesn't get 8 hours of sleep).</p><p>Warforged were created by Cannith within the last 30 years, and as a result, their life expectancy is unknown. Older warforged have begun to show signs of physical decay, indicating that they may eventually degrade. Though it is still unclear (and Cannith has never provided a clear answer), it appears that warforged may have innate souls. A warforged's body is as vulnerable to destruction as any other creature's body is, and warforged that have been destroyed require magical intervention such as resurrection magic to restore themselves.</p><p>As constructs, warforged have no concept of gender - nor is their body designed to a specific gendered shape. Though some warforged have selected a gender identity, most warforged are unaware or choose to ignore the concept altogether.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Warforged were created as soldiers to fight in the last war, and have only gained their freedom within the last two years. As a result, warforged do not have any established cultures or traditions, or any sort of developed place in society. Most warforged have picked up the culture of the nation they fought for, and others have latched on to bits and pieces that interest them creating a mixed celebration of traditions. Since most warforged struggle to relate to other humanoids, most of the time they will band together with other warforged who provide a sense of familiarity. Sometimes this group is those they fought with in the last war, other times it is simply others like them who decided to settle in the local area.</p><p>Sometimes warforged prefer to lead solitary lives or work to integrate themselves into other humanoid societies. Some warforged wander Khorvaire, looking to find purpose and meaning for themselves and have become ambassadors between cultures.</p><h2>Philosophy and Religion</h2><p>As constructs of war, Warforged were built to fight without questioning orders - though they are capable of doing so. Warforged are capable of emotion and moral reasoning, however, this is something few were trained or practiced in and most struggle to comprehend.</p><p>Warforged similarly tend to be unreligious. As a soldier some warforged have picked up the religion of their humanoid companions, beginning the follow the Sovereign Host as a soldier of Cyre, or the Silver Flame as a Thranish soldier, but independently most have not been drawn to religion. Warforged that have begun to follow a religion have sometimes found an answer to the questions of their existence and their purpose in life, but these warforged are few between.</p><p>Some warforged have begun to be drawn towards a messianic figure called the Lord of Blades. The Lord of Blades has begun to gather a cult-like following of warforged by promising purpose to the disaffected and a rebellion against the \"weak-fleshed\" ancestries.</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Most warforged do not have a name for themselves beyond their creation number such as unit 4859. Only after being able to experience the world outside of military structure have they begun to understand the need of other races to have names for everything. Many warforged accept any name that others give them, and warforged working in proximity to other humanoids are often are referred to by nicknames. Some warforged, however, have come to see having a name as a defining moment of their new existence, and thus search long and hard for the perfect name to attach to themselves.</p><p><strong>Sample Names<br /></strong>Anchor, Banner, Bastion, Blade, Blue, Bow, Cart, Church, Crunch, Crystal, Dagger, Dent, Five, Glaive, Hammer, Iron, Lucky, Mace, Oak, Onyx, Pants, Pierce, Red, Rod, Rusty, Scout, Seven, Shield, Slash, Smith, Spike, Temple, Vault, Wall</p><h2>Game Information</h2><h3>Ancestry</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-ancestries.72Q9tuBT32gfOoVT]{Warforged}</p><h3>Heritages</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.D2dVPAXRroBDdO3B]{Juggernaut Warforged}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.Hf9u3K8zdGqbhcvh]{Living Wand Warforged}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.stRstbbHlqm4UUMs]{Skilled Warforged}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.dBFW4wjPj7fHiaIC]{Skirmisher Warforged}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-heritages.uVb4HYVLJPcRFE2H]{Vanguard Warforged}</p><h2>Ancestry Feats</h2><h3>Level 01</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.6FkkWtPm2iZMRoqS]{Alchemical Resistance}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.MnamqaqMBzLUAPLR]{Alert Scout}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.4LDiHM8Nqwm714dw]{Dark Vision}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.1QxrS0za6mngBeXt]{Emotionless}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.y8bcW57hknu0t3Ll]{Integrated Tool}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.vTpuU0ZYYSCy59gI]{Replaceable Integrated Armor}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.MBdp0SoDgKM3LUPH]{Skilled Capability}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.eqXSNGBSn7WnKsTr]{Warforged Armament}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.DthjfGCl4zt8TZMr]{Warforged Lore}</p><h3>Level 05</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.KwpfeOvzbzR7jyF4]{Arcane Safeguards}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.C7IQfzE6SjFO5cb9]{Disease Resistance}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.GESEcvqFnsqRWtRM]{Magical Resistance}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.h7bcge2ThkEpVZlM]{Incredible Defense}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.vqCWHavjAmcpVOHK]{Integrated Armament}</p><h3>Level 09</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.K9OwRnT3leGcerW7]{Arcane Attunement}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.UYmyBZYEJKmwrmhd]{Greenshadow}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.pDTcFHE0MjcPFAxn]{Internal Processing}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.lTkhKpYWbDpipwSL]{Juggernaut Repair}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.H2MfOCIuswjBwEdp]{Lesser Augmentation}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.UYhDnhBRoEVkCyOZ]{Slam}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.qFzPywQobhnjRpUG]{Warforged Offense}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.oF8gGW62EleC4W35]{Precious Material Tracery}</p><h3>Level 13</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.84oidazeYxVhjves]{Construct Rejuvenation}@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.mqSLB8cBrtcoNQOZ]{Enhanced Locomotion}</p><h3>Level 17</h3><p>@Compendium[pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-feats.8hkUTfDTD2s9WLyv]{Greater Augmentation}</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"knTUi1bTspduSmIG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.ZZalxItG9XQtnH01"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1670009014051,"modifiedTime":1674934720542,"lastModifiedBy":"knTUi1bTspduSmIG"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"yrAE1gvH4MSvLhd5"}
