{"name":"Wandslinger","type":"class","system":{"description":{"value":"<blockquote>\n<p>The development of the cantrip — casual spells that can be used at will — took centuries, as the Arcane Congress studied Aereni techniques and the powers of sorcery. The soldiers of the united kingdom relied on sword and bow. But as the Last War began, Aundair took stock of its resources. Thanks to the presence of the Arcane Congress, Aundair led Galifar in mystical education. Assembling the first regiment of arcane dragoons, Aundair developed the war staff and battle rod. Over the course of the Last War, these techniques spread across the Five Nations and beyond. Today it’s no surprise to see a tough inquisitive or a Sentinel Marshal with a sword in one hand and a wand in the other. But no one calls these people “arcane dragoons.” If you fight your battles with fire bolt or sacred flame, you’re known as a “wandslinger\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Artificers have developed a method of unlocking the innate magical properties of dragonshards to explosive effect by grinding, processing and refining Eberron dragonshards via an alchemical process into fine powder. The magical energy within this <strong>Shardpowder </strong>can then, using a fairly advanced alchemical crafting process, be contained in small glass vials, with its innate magical energy ready to erupt from the vial given the right focus. These vials are used to power the blasts created by uniquely crafted wands and staves, each inlaid with mithral and capped by a finely machined Sibery dragonshard. Collectively these weapons are called <strong>Blastshards</strong>, though they are still referred to as Wands and Staves almost exclusively. Those that specialize in these new weapons are called <strong>Wandslingers</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Ability: DEXTERITY</strong></p>\n<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an ability boost to Dexterity.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points: 8 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>\n<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>\n<h1>Roleplaying the Wandslinger</h1>\n<h2>During Combat Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You strike from range with your wands and staves, seeking to defeat your opponents before they can pose a true threat. Depending on your choice of weapon, you might prefer to strike your opponent from a hidden position before they ever realize you're there, dash through a frenzied melee with wands blazing, or glide effortlessly across the battlefield, waiting for the perfect moment to end the conflict with a single, well-placed blast.</p>\n<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You have a keen eye and can see things coming from farther than most. You might not be the life of the party, but your companions know to pay attention when your subtle nod or concerned grunt indicates that something's amiss.</p>\n<h2>While Exploring...</h2>\n<p>You scout the group's position for incoming threats and help search for secret doors and <a class=\"content-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-uuid=\"Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC\" data-id=\"iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC\" data-type=\"Item\" data-pack=\"pf2e.conditionitems\" data-tooltip=\"Condition Item\">Hidden</a> passages, keeping a weather eye out for unexpected threats.</p>\n<h2>In Downtime...</h2>\n<p>You might craft shardpowder vials or keep your complex magical weapons clean and maintained, and you might look for work that matches your unique talents, such as working as an artificer, alchemist, or part of the local watch. You might wander from town to town, or stay put for a spell to enjoy the silence that lingers between fights.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Seek out areas of great conflict where your unique choice of weaponry can help build your reputation.</li>\n<li>Explore new horizons, trusting your honed senses and deadly weapon to keep you safe.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate extensive knowledge about various types of magic and wands, along with curiosity about the latest in wand technology.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume that since you know how your blastshard works, you must also understand how to resolve other arcane challenges.</li>\n<li>Underestimate you at first glance, thinking you rely on your wand because you lack any other skills.</li>\n<li>Respect your eternal vigilance, unyielding grit, and excellent aim.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

At 1st level, your way grants you an initial deed, a unique reload action called a slinger's reload, and proficiency with a particular skill. You also gain advanced and greater deeds at later levels, as well as access to way-specific feats. The wandslinger ways are described in detail on page 108. The following ways are presented in this book.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Drifter</strong> You wander across the battlefield, equally at home in and out of the fray.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Pistolero</strong> You carefully maintain your distance at a duelist's 10 paces with wand in hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Sniper</strong> You practice a methodical style of shooting, striking from far cover.</p>\n<p><strong>Way of the Vanguard</strong> You rely on a brutal combat style that uses heavy weapons and explosive attacks.</p>\n<h2>Wandslinger Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a gunslinger class feat.</p>\n<h2>Singular Expertise</h2>\n<p>You have particular expertise with blastshards and crossbows that grants you greater proficiency with them and the ability to deal more damage. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage rolls with blastshards and crossbows.</p>\n<p>This intense focus on blastshards and crossbows prevents you from reaching the same heights with other weapons. Your proficiency with unarmed attacks and with weapons other than blastshards and crossbows can't be higher than trained, even if you gain an ability that would increase your proficiency in one or more other weapons to match your highest weapon proficiency (such as the weapon expertise feats many ancestries have). If you have wandslinger weapon mastery, the limit is expert, and if you have wandslinging legend, the limit is master.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Stubborn<span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You don't like being told what to do, and you don't give up. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert. When you fail, but don't critically fail, a Will save against an effect that would give you the controlled condition, you can attempt a second save against the effect at the start of your next turn. On a successful second save, the controlled condition ends, though any other effects remain. As normal, failing this second save doesn't allow you to attempt a third save on the subsequent turn.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Wandslinger Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand the best way to utilize your unique weapons. Your proficiency rank increases to master with simple and martial blastshards and crossbows. Your proficiency rank for advanced blastshards and crossbows, simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects for blastshards and crossbows.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Deed<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned a powerful new technique of your chosen way. You gain the advanced deed ability of the way you chose at 1st level.</p>\n<h2>Wandslinger Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your special shots become harder for opponents to predict or resist. Your proficiency rank for your wandslinger class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Evasion<span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Wandslinging Legend<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned unique techniques for wielding  blastshards and crossbows that give you unmatched skill in their use. Your proficiency rank increases to legendary with simple and martial blastshards and crossbows and to master with advanced blastshards and crossbows. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to defend yourself better against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Greater Deed<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You've mastered the pinnacle technique of your chosen way. You gain the greater deed ability of the way you chose at 1st level.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your body has become accustomed to physical hazards and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Blaster's Edge<span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You make shots others find impossible. Your proficiency rank for your wandslinger class DC increases to master. When using a ranged weapon in which you have master or greater proficiency, you ignore the penalty for attacking within the weapon's second and third range increments.</p>\n<h2>Incredible Senses<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You notice things that most people can't detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Mastery<span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge or absorb blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to master.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"uncommon","custom":""},"rules":[{"definition":["item:category:simple","item:group:hb_blastshard"],"key":"MartialProficiency","label":"Simple Blastshards","slug":"simple-blastshards","value":2},{"definition":["item:category:advanced","item:group:hb_blastshard"],"key":"MartialProficiency","label":"Advanced Blastshards","slug":"advanced-blastshards","value":1},{"definition":["item:category:martial","item:group:hb_blastshard"],"key":"MartialProficiency","label":"Martial Blastshards","slug":"martial-blastshards","value":2}],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.813,"lastMigration":null},"keyAbility":{"value":["dex"]},"items":{"R2ppB":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-class-features.eqFKjbs5M4sxnb3h","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/choice-feature.webp","name":"Wandslinger's Way","level":1},"0xcSH":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-class-features.HXLraSSvFDkhSoqa","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/singular-expertise.webp","name":"Singular Expertise (Wandslinger)","level":1},"ov8hS":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Wpdeh6EkcAKA60oH","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/resolve.webp","name":"Stubborn","level":3},"rLFHe":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-class-features.8Jvhv7GMJFyGudBL","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/gunslinger-weapon-mastery.webp","name":"Wandslinger Weapon Mastery","level":5},"qXIFG":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.9EqIasqfI8YIM3Pt","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Weapon Specialization","level":7},"N1DgZ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.0npO4rPscGm0dX13","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/vigilant-senses.webp","name":"Vigilant Senses","level":7},"ymfvD":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-class-features.uBXNnvjMCWXUOF86","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/gunslinger-expertise.webp","name":"Wandslinger Expertise","level":9},"Su5qH":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-class-features.LHebQmqCHQXsb40x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/advanced-deed.webp","name":"Advanced Deed (Wandslinger)","level":9},"coZaZ":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.MV6XIuAgN9uSA0Da","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/evasion.webp","name":"Evasion","level":11},"Ogpo3":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.FCEp9jjxxgRJDJV3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/medium-armor-expertise.webp","name":"Medium Armor Expertise","level":13},"vEZYk":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-class-features.xwi9AFQY8TOuyrrc","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/greater-deed.webp","name":"Greater Deed (Wandslinger)","level":15},"aJxiH":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-class-features.s9UJoiVLzekxjVdw","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/gunslinging-legend.webp","name":"Wandslinging Legend","level":13},"ozVai":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Z7HX6TeFsaup7Dx9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/greater-weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Greater Weapon Specialization","level":15},"o3H9G":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.OMZs5y16jZRW9KQK","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/juggerenaut.webp","name":"Juggernaut","level":17},"tjCjY":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.cGMSYAErbUG5E8X2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/medium-armor-mastery.webp","name":"Medium Armor Mastery","level":19},"xELUv":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.nLwPMPLRne1HnL00","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/incredible-sense.webp","name":"Incredible Senses","level":19},"Enkt7":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-class-features.kiJ9sQzDHOQxhPc2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/shootists-edge.webp","name":"Blaster's Edge","level":17}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":[],"additional":3},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":2,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":1,"advanced":0,"unarmed":0,"other":{"name":"Simple Blastshards, Martial Blastshards","rank":2}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":1,"heavy":0},"classDC":1,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"img":"modules/pf2e-for-eberron/images/wandslinger.png","effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"knTUi1bTspduSmIG":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.NzELCADO7p73XuFu"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1673385799604,"modifiedTime":1673637950642,"lastModifiedBy":"knTUi1bTspduSmIG"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"gaeCW62oBlEA52FC"}
