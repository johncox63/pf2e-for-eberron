You Cast a Spell from a wand, staff or blastshard that takes 1, 2, or 3 actions and requires a spell attack roll. Reduce the number of actions required by 1 (minimum 0). The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into your wand, staff or blastshard instead. Until the item is used, it is considered a loaded blastshard.

Additionally. After spending the first actions to cast the spell, the effects occur when the Strike action is used to discharge the spell like a fired bullet.</p>\n<p>For instance, you could use Spellfire to imbue your blastshard with Ray of Frost by spending 1 action, then make a regular strike or use an ability such as Blast Lock, Called Shot, Cauterize, Cover Fire, Paired Shots, Penetrating Fire, or Ricochet Shot where Ray of Frost replaces one of the strikes.</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Targeting:</strong> The spell targets only one target of your Strike, even if it normally allows more targets. If your Strike targets more than one target such as with Bullet Split or Penetrating Fire, only one target takes the effects of the spell and the additional targets instead take the take force damage equal to your spellcasting modifier.</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Misfire:</strong> If your wand would \"misfire\" as a result of the ability you used, you instead take force damage equal to your level.</p>\n<p class=\"hang\"><strong>Ancillary Effects:</strong> Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, acid splash would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and tanglefoot's circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration.
