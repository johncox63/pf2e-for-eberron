As the war came to an end, warforged were recognized and granted their rights as humanoids by the Treaty of Thronehold. Now, they are soldiers whose only purpose has come to an end and must find meaning in a world that has abandoned them.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Warforged were created as expendable construct soldiers to fight in the last war. Early Cannith development of the warforged war focused on the production of warforged such as the warforged titans which were true constructs - machines of war built to destroy, kill, and die on command. With further refinements and arcane experimentation, the warforged evolved until they were a new type of creature - a living construct. This advancement in development was made possible by the creation forges but came with the side-effect of adding sentience to the new construct known only as warforged. However, with their single-minded focus and combat prowess, sentience empowered warforged with a desire to preserve themselves than Cannith's other mindless constructs exhibit - making them a more efficient soldier than simple golems.</p>\n<p>In the wake of the Last War, the Treaty of Thronehold has granted warforged their rights and freedom from being used as bought-and-sold soldiers of nations. This newfound freedom for warforged is a double-edged sword, as many warforged struggle to find a place in a world that no longer cares for them. Some warforged have taken up new employments as labourers and artisans; many warforged have taken on employment doing what they already know and fight fiercely as a soldier. The warforged that fight on have taken roles as guards, mercenaries, adventurers, and some have found their way back into the employment of armies. Warforged in these roles make steadfast allies and fearsome enemies. They fight with a vigour that most humanoids struggle to match - but with the ability to adapt and learn that mindless constructs can not replicate.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">You might…</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have scars and wounds from fighting in the last war, dealing with old injuries and trauma that has never healed</li>\n<li>Often misread other creatures' emotions, struggling to understand their - and your own - feelings</li>\n<li>Apply wartime thinking to every situation, analyzing every situation as a tactical puzzle<br /> </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Others Probably…</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe you do not experience emotions and are incapable of higher thinking beyond your programming</li>\n<li>Are an expendable asset, and to be taken advantage of for your tireless nature and lack of world experience outside the war</li>\n<li>See you as a valuable ally to have on the battlefield, even if sometimes they struggle to relate to you</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div class=\"bg-paper page d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Physical Description…</h2>\n<p>Warforged appear to be a completely constructed creature. Their frame is composed of a composite of materials—obsidian, iron, stone, darkwood, silver, and organic material. Around a warforged's frame is a musculature is composed of root-like cords infused with alchemical liquids that grant strength and surprising grace and flexibility to their body. Their exterior is covered in a series of flexible metallic or leather plates, creating a form of integrated armour which grants them protection on the battlefield. This integrated armour is attached directly into their body by the root-like tendrils of their musculature and is extremely painful to remove. Most warforged share a similar facial structure, with a hinged jaw and crystal eys embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. The specific composition and structure of each warforged changes depending on their intended purpose, but all warforged are humanoid in shape.</p>\n<p>Unique among constructs, warforged have learned to modify their bodies through magic and training. These unique changes that warforged choose helps define their personality and differentiate their physical form from one warforged from another.</p>\n<p>As constructs, warforged typically don't need to breathe, eat, or sleep; however, the body of a warforged needs to vent alchemical impurities at a constant rate. This venting process requires breathable air to prevent a buildup of impurities in a warforged's alchemical fluids which can seize a warforged's biological components, sometimes to fatal effect. Thus, warforged can still suffocate much like living creatures, but can in a limited sense hold their breath as other humanoid creatures can. Though they don't sleep, warforged require a period of restoration to allow the alchemical fluids of their body to replenish. Without this process, a warforged is incapable of fully restoring their body and they enter an inefficient state (similar to a humanoid who doesn't get 8 hours of sleep).</p>\n<p>Warforged were created by Cannith within the last 30 years, and as a result, their life expectancy is unknown. Older warforged have begun to show signs of physical decay, indicating that they may eventually degrade. Though it is still unclear (and Cannith has never provided a clear answer), it appears that warforged may have innate souls. A warforged's body is as vulnerable to destruction as any other creature's body is, and warforged that have been destroyed require magical intervention such as resurrection magic to restore themselves.</p>\n<p>As constructs, warforged have no concept of gender - nor is their body designed to a specific gendered shape. Though some warforged have selected a gender identity, most warforged are unaware or choose to ignore the concept altogether.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Society…</h2>\n<p>Warforged were created as soldiers to fight in the last war, and have only gained their freedom within the last two years. As a result, warforged do not have any established cultures or traditions, or any sort of developed place in society. Most warforged have picked up the culture of the nation they fought for, and others have latched on to bits and pieces that interest them creating a mixed celebration of traditions. Since most warforged struggle to relate to other humanoids, most of the time they will band together with other warforged who provide a sense of familiarity. Sometimes this group is those they fought with in the last war, other times it is simply others like them who decided to settle in the local area.</p>\n<p>Sometimes warforged prefer to lead solitary lives or work to integrate themselves into other humanoid societies. Some warforged wander Khorvaire, looking to find purpose and meaning for themselves and have become ambassadors between cultures.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"bg-paper page d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"page-overlay\"> </div>\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Alignment and Religion…</h2>\n<p>Warforged tend to be neutrally aligned. As constructs of war, they were built to fight without questioning orders - though they are capable of doing so. Warforged are capable of emotion and moral reasoning, however, this is something few were trained or practised in and most struggle to comprehend.</p>\n<p>Warforged similarly tend to be unreligious. As a soldier some warforged have picked up the religion of their humanoid companions, beginning the follow the Sovereign Host as a soldier of Cyre, or the Silver Flame as a Thranish soldier, but independently most have not been drawn to religion. Warforged that have begun to follow a religion have sometimes found an answer to the questions of their existence and their purpose in life, but these warforged are few between.</p>\n<p>Some warforged have begun to be drawn towards a messianic figure called the Lord of Blades. The Lord of Blades has begun to gather a cult-like following of warforged by promising purpose to the disaffected and a rebellion against the \"weak-fleshed\" ancestries.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Names…</h2>\n<p>Most warforged do not have a name for themselves beyond their creation number such as unit 4859. Only after being able to experience the world outside of military structure have they begun to understand the need of other races to have names for everything. Many warforged accept any name that others give them, and warforged working in proximity to other humanoids are often are referred to by nicknames. Some warforged, however, have come to see having a name as a defining moment of their new existence, and thus search long and hard for the perfect name to attach to themselves.</p>\n<h3>Sample warforged names</h3>\n<p>Anchor, Banner, Bastion, Blade, Blue, Bow, Cart, Church, Crunch, Crystal, Dagger, Dent, Five, Glaive, Hammer, Iron, Lucky, Mace, Oak, Onyx, Pants, Pierce, Red, Rod, Rusty, Scout, Seven, Shield, Slash, Smith, Spike, Temple, Vault, Wall<br />  </p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Integrated Armor</h2>\n<p>Your heritage grants you one type of integrated armour, as noted below.

While shifters cannot completely change like werecreatures, they can shift to take on the features of their beast within. From their beast within a shifter gains extraordinary abilities, such as deadly fangs, refined senses, speed, and other similar traits.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Shifters are a diverse ancestry that combines the traits of humanoid and beast heritage, not unlike a were-creature. At a young age, each shifter discovers their beast within, which comes to define who they are as a person. With the ability to draw on their inherent beast to temporarily shift into a more animalistic version of themselves, they are sometimes also referred to as the were-touched. While some believe shifters are the descendants of werecreatures, the opposite is true. The first werecreatures to plague Khorvaire are said to be shifters who were cursed with great evil. Shifters are unrelated to modern werecreatures and are a distinct ancestry of Eberron with unique cultures and traditions.</p>\n<p>Despite the distinction between shifters and werecreatures, shifters were persecuted during the fifty-year crusade against werecreatures less than two centuries ago. Targeted by the crusaders who fought against the rising lycanthrope tide, many innocent shifters were killed in the crusade to eliminate the threat. Since then, most shifters across Khorvaire prefer to live in enclaves or districts of other shifters - avoiding other ancestries which may still bear them ill will.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">You might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Prefer the companionship of other shifters or a close group of friends.</li>\n<li>Feel strong emotions, typically manifesting in the spirit of your beast within.</li>\n<li>View survival as a challenge, and strive to be self-reliant, adaptable, and resourceful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Others Probably... </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume that you have a natural connection to animals and the natural world.

While travelling, shifters tend to move in springs and leaps rather than simply walking alongside their humanoid companions. Their faces and bodies typically show traits of their beast within, such as longer fangs, pointed ears, feline eyes, and other such features. Their bodies -especially their legs and forearms -are typically covered in more hair than a human, creating a fur-like covering over their limbs. </p>\n<p>A shifter's stance is typically upright with their weight placed on only the front of their clawed feet, creating a semi-digitigrade look. </p>\n<p>A Shifters' beast within is more obvious when they are transformed into their hybrid shape, their features shifting to resemble the animal to which they are connected. The manifestation of these features varies from shifter to shifter, but typically, their teeth become more prominent, their skin toughens like hide, their hair lengthens, and their eyes reshape. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Society... </h2>\n<p>Shifters are a relatively uncommon race in the Five Nations, there are more changelings in Breland than there are shifters. Yet, the shifters who live throughout Khorvaire have formed tight-knit communities. There are two primary types of shifter communities. The first type of community is a nomadic tribal hunter-gather pack, common in the remote woods of the Eldeen Reaches. The other is common in urban centres where shifters form small enclaves to hold on to their traditions and remain with those who understand their ways.</p>\n<p>The communities of the deep forests of the Eldeen Reaches are typically formed out of a desire to be free of the control of nations and other ancestries. These communities are frequently nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes and are primarily composed of shifters. While it is not unheard of to have other ancestries present in a tribe, shifters typically tend to prefer to bond with fellow shifters. Here the culture and traditions of the shifter communities are strongest, as the shifter community cooperates for the good of one another and the survival of the community. </p>\n<p>Shifter communities of the enclaves of major cities typically form as a result of shifters desire to hold on to their culture and traditions. As the minority in many of these urban regions, without these tight-knit groups shifters struggle to hold on to the culture and traditions of their upbringing.  </p>\n<p>While the shifter parents are dedicated to raising their children, the family structure is different from many other ancestries. Shifter children typically form a strong bond with a few other children around their age group. Though the children in these groups are typically from many different families, this initial bond is often the strongest bond that a shifter forms in their life. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Alignment and Religion... </h2>\n<p>Shifters are typically neutral and view the world as a struggle to survive. The moral and ethical concerns of a shifter are typically centred around the well-being of those directly around them. However, shifters are as varied in alignment as they are in the animals that they draw ancestry from, and can be inclined to any alignment. </p>\n<p>After the silver crusade, shifters have become suspicious of any outside religion. Having seen how religion can motivate people, they view intense or conflict-prone religions as terrifying forces capable of causing great harm. As a result, shifters' religions are typically varied and less intense than many would expect of their culture.  </p>\n<p>Many shifters follow some form of druidic worship. The most common druidic worship of shifters is that of the order of druids known as the moonspeakers. These moonspeakers draw meaning from the movements of the moons and believe that the moon's influence over their heritage gives the moons great power over shifters. </p>\n<p>Other shifters who reside in the major cities of Khorvaire have taken up worship of the local religion. Many shifters in the urban centres of Khorvaire revere Balinor and Boldrei of the Sovereign Host, and many shifter adventurers revere the ways of the Traveller of the Dark Six. </p>\n<p>During the silver purge, some shifters adopted the faith of the Silver Flame and participated in the crusade. There are still shifters active in the church of the silver flame, though to much scorn of other shifters. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Names... </h2>\n<p>Shifters typically take on names similar to that of humans, or that of the community around them though with a more rustic inclination.

Though they appear slow, they are capable of great bursts of strength or speed when necessary. Many yearn to prove their mettle on the battlefield, risking their lives to earn the glory known as atcha. Others instead find themselves at peace in small isolated clans, moving in flow with the nature around them. </em></p>\n<hr style=\"border-top:1px solid var(--color-border-light-primary);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light-highlight)\" />\n<p>Bugbears, for many, are monsters belonging to storybooks and nightmares. Stories speak of bugbears as great hairy beasts that lurk in the shadows - it is the bugbears that lie in the darkness undetected, waiting for the children that strayed off the beaten path or too far from their parents, or for the villagers wandering out at night away from their homes. They drag the foolish and unsuspecting to their den to be devoured alive; worse, if they cut off your head, your soul is bound to Eberron and can never reach Dolurrh. </p>\n<p>These terrible and fearsome stories flowered from small seeds of truth. Most bugbears, despite their size, rely on stealth and the cover of night to surprise their enemies - expending great bursts of energy to end fights before the victim can react. However, bugbears themselves are no more likely to eat other humanoids than humans themselves. The true bugbears of the forest, unlike those expected from human folklore, tend towards peace and the flow of nature rather than violence. After the Last War, many more stories of stoic bugbear rangers or druids guiding lost troops to safety through impossible terrain have been retold by soldiers. </p>\n<p>Alongside this, new stories of bugbears are being forged by Darguun, a nation that rose from the ashes of the Last War. There are also many stories yet untold of the militant bugbears belonging to the secretive Dhakaani Empire. </p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">You might...</h2>\n<p>- Present an air of indolence that hides the vicious ferocity you display in battle.</p>\n<p>- Use your great strength, long limbs, and endurance to perform feats of athletics that few others are capable of.</p>\n<p>- Move slowly and in time with the world around you, listening and waiting until the time is right to expend your energy.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Others Probably...</h2>\n<p>- Walk and talk cautiously around you, in fear of invoking your ire.</p>\n<p>- Look to use your might to their advantage, assuming that you are easily outsmarted.</p>\n<p>- Underestimate your silent step - assuming that your great mass could not possibly move as quietly as the stories say.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Physical Description...</h2>\n<p>These stealthy and strong goblinoid creatures can thrive in the mayhem of battle or move slowly with the world around them - regardless they usually conserve their great reserves of energy until needed. Standing between 6 to 8 feet tall and weighing 250 to 300lbs, bugbears outsize most humanoids that they meet. Bugbears are typically extremely muscular, able to lift and move great weights with their long limbs. They are covered in thick short yellowish fur and share the same pointed ears as their goblinoid cousins. Due to their longer limbs, weapons wielded in the hands of bugbears have a greater reach than typical. </p>\n<p>Despite their great size, bugbears show an uncanny ability to sneak up on the unsuspecting. They can use their quiet step and darkvision to move quietly through the night, unnoticed if they so desire.</p>\n<p>Bugbears reach physical adulthood around the age of 16, and they can live up to 80 years. For those that strive for glory in battle or perform dangerous manual labour, death by old age is far less common. </p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Society...</h2>\n<p>Of the communities bugbears can belong to, the ones that are primarily goblinoid are Dhakaan, Darguun, or the isolated druidic communities found throughout Khorvaire but primarily in the Khraal. </p>\n<p>Dhakaani society is bound by the philosophy of mu'ut and atcha, both respectively meaning the duty to one's empire and personal honour[46]. The martial culture and rigid caste system of Dhakaan places bugbears in roles of aiding with demanding physical labour and being amongst the strongest warriors. </p>\n<section class=\"info\" style=\"border-radius:var(--radius);font-family:var(--sans-serif);padding-bottom:var(--space-m)\">\n<p style=\"padding-top:var(--space-m)\">See Exploring Eberron (p. 96) for more information on Dhakaani Society.</p>\n</section>\n<p style=\"margin-top:var(--space-xl)\">Darguun, on the other hand, is a nation carved out of Cyre by goblinoid mercenaries during the Last War. While bugbears found in this region are likely to still place importance on their physical might and rely on their innate strength, they do not have the same venerance of mu'ut and atcha that characterizes the Dhakaani within their culture. </p>\n<p>Acting as a counterpart to both regions, the druidic bugbears find an alternative path of life, not abandoning their strengths and stealth, but rather using them to meld into the nature surrounding them. These communities of bugbears are smaller and less centralized. Often druids, rangers, or wisdom's guide these communities. </p>\n<p>However, bugbears can also be found integrated within human settlements, and needn't originate from strictly goblinoid communities. These bugbears often take up the culture of the nations they are found in and can play a diversity of roles within them. </p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Alignment and Religion...</h2>\n<p>The religion of an individual bugbear depends on the culture in which they were raised. Bugbears of the Dhakaani Empire do not subscribe to a set religion but share the same spiritual connection to Uul Dhakaan, a dreamlike nation that guides the Empire. Alongside this, Dhakaani venerate historical conquests, their previous leaders and warriors, and their past through story-telling.

Their frightening visage and efficient tactics have given them an ill-starred reputation.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Gnolls began their existence being bred for and recruited by the overlords of War, Rak Tulkhesh, and the Wild, the Wild Heart. They served as foot soldiers, fighting against orcs, the early humanoids of Khorvaire, as well as the other gnoll clans belonging to opposing overlords. Even after the overlords were bound by the Silver Flame, gnolls continued to act as their pawns.</p>\n<p>This subjugation was broken by a revelation shared between two rival clans of gnolls in the midst of a battle; their fur soaked by blood and wading through limbs and carnage, they questioned what had led them to destroy their kin. The two clans then turned to each other and formed an alliance, urging their brethren to deny the voices that called for endless war and refuse to chase death in the service of any fiend. The two clans coalesced with many more, and those who absolved themselves of servitude took their idols to the Znir - a word that means stone - and destroyed the sculptures of the fiends that kept them bound to violence. All of these clans - warrior, shaman, hunter - vowed that no god, chib, nor demon would hold dominion over them and while their clans differed, they all were of the same pact. These were the ancestors of the Znir Pact gnolls, now found throughout Khorvaire but most prevalently in Droaam.</p>\n<p>There are still gnolls that remained bound to the overlords, lacking the freedom of their Znir kin. Is your Gnoll of the long-standing Znir pack, or have they recently been liberated from the grasp of the overlords, trying to find their way through Khorvaire?</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Always try to work smarter, not harder.</li>\n<li>Be very physically demonstrative—often hugging, punching, or licking your friends.</li>\n<li>Keep a bone from a favorite relative to ask for advice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are intimidated by your size, teeth, and eerie laugh.</li>\n<li>Assume that you are dishonorable or worse.</li>\n<li>Respect the brutal efficiency of your hunting style.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>A typical gnoll stands over seven feet in height, but this is belied by their hunched posture. Males and females are similar in appearance, and other species have difficulty telling them apart. Gnolls have thick fur over their bodies; depending on clan, this can be uniform in colour or broken up with spots or stripes. Their eyes are yellow or green and gleam with reflected light. While these are common traits, the fiendish heritage of gnolls sometimes manifests itself in its appearance. An unusual gnoll could have glowing red eyes, fur with stripes that glow like flames, or other unusual traits. Typically these don’t grant special abilities, though you could attribute a class ability or feat to such a mutation.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The Znir gnolls include a dozen different clans, each of which holds distinct traditions. Once the clans were devoted to different faces of the overlords, but when they shattered their statues, each clan chose one of the moons. All gnolls skillfully hunt and fight, but the Barrakas are known to be the finest trackers of the Pact; the Aryth, the deadliest archers; the Olarune, the strongest warriors and most forceful in the vanguard. Typically, mercenary units are comprised of gnolls of a single clan, assigned based on the nature of the task that lies ahead, and contracts are usually negotiated for a period based on cycles of the clan’s moon.</p>\n<p>The clans maintain distinct territories within the Znir region, but all gnolls are welcome around the hearth of any clan; the Znir take pains to crush any tension that arises between the clans. Shamans and leaders from each clan maintain a council at the Znir, around the idols their ancestors broke. Here they mediate disputes, assign contracts to clans, and allocate funds and equipment. The Eyre clan has honed their skills as smiths and tanners, and they craft much of the equipment used by the Znir gnolls-though there is still a strong tradition of scavenging among the Znir, and warriors often claim trophies from fallen foes.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Gnolls have very strong pack instincts, and an unsentimental matter-of-fact approach to life, and prioritize results over methods. [50] They instinctively work together in combat and think nothing of placing themselves in harm’s way to protect their kin. If a gnoll character adopts a group of adventurers as their temporary pack, these things apply to the other characters - but the gnoll will be surprised and angry if their non-gnoll packmates don’t show them the same respect. This means the typical gnoll trends towards a Lawful alignment, but good and evil depend on the current terms of their contract.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>A Gnoll's most important identifier is its whoop. While deceptively short, a whoop includes a range of ultrasonic inflexions that indicate clan, a personal identifier, and a suggestion of family affiliation (the Znir trace lineage through the mother). Because it’s impossible for most non-gnolls to properly replicate a whoop, gnolls also use contract names-names intended to be used with clients and other outsiders. There is a basic structure of contract names used by all gnolls; the inflexion of the name indicates gender, though few people recognize this if they don’t speak Gnoll. The Znir typically attach clan names to a formal introduction: “Ghyrryn Barrakas, Znir.”</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Dagnyr, Dhyrn, Ghyrryn, Gnasc, Gnoryc, Gnyrn, Gnyrl, Hyrn, Lhoryn, Lhyr, Lhyrl, Mognyr, Myrl, Sorgnyn, Thyrn, Toryc, Yrgnyn, Yrych</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Gnoll Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Strength, Intelligence, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw</strong> Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Gnoll</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

They may be shunned and feared, but they will never be destroyed.” Jes agreed, and the Traveller gave her his cloak.

In particular, their abilities allow them to take the form of other humanoid creatures with little limitation on who. Many use their gifts as a form of artistic expression or to convey their current emotional state, adopting certain personas depending on the context of their moods. However, it does not go unnoticed by many, including some changelings themselves, that their ability is an invaluable tool for grifters, spies, and those whose aims are to deceive. This leads many people to treat changelings with general suspicion.</span></div>\n<div class=\"content w-100\"> </div>\n<div class=\"content w-100\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Changelings are born to one of three paths. A few are raised in stable communities where changelings are true to their nature and deal openly with the people around them. Some are orphans, raised by other races, who find their way in the world without ever knowing another like themselves. Others are part of nomadic changeling clans spread across the Five Nations, families who keep their true nature hidden from the single-skins. Some clans maintain safe havens in major cities and communities, but most prefer to wander the unpredictable path of the god known as the Traveler. Wherever humans live, changelings reside also; the question is whether they make their presence known.</span></div>\n<div class=\"content w-100\"> </div>\n<div class=\"content w-100\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">A persona is known as the faces and personalities each changeling chooses to adopt - based on where changelings are born their personas are likely to vary. A changeling born in an isolated community might only possess one persona that they developed, using a single face as they exist on Khorvaire, while those belonging to a community of changelings will have multiple personas and perhaps come to share them with one another, each being \"Tamirin the Traveling </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Seamstress\" on different days of the week.</span></div>\n<div class=\"content w-100\"> </div>\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">You might…</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Shift your shape to a persona that matches your mood or current activity.

Their base form is a nondescript humanoid shape with white skin, hair, and featureless eyes - not unlike a mannequin. Beyond this, because of their ability to shift-shape, changelings do not have a set physical description.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Society…</h2>\n<p>Changeling society is fragmented, and no two groups of changelings have the same culture. However, for changelings that live in areas where other of their kind reside, and often shared feature is a fluidity in concepts of identity, gender, and personality. Changelings that aim to master the form of shapechanging and mimicry tend to treat each persona as a real being, breathing life into reach persona. Some almost eternal figures of local legend, like the vampires lurking in abandoned fortresses, are instead multi-generational efforts of changeling families, all inheriting the persona when they are deemed ready. Is your changeling adventuring to prove they are worthy of inheriting one of these legendary personas?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"bg-paper page d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"content\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Alignment and Religion…</h2>\n<p>Changelings tend towards pragmatic neutrality, and few changelings embrace evil. As changelings are primarily products of the culture in which they grow, their moral alignment tends to match the alignment of their peers. Similarly, for religion, a changeling might be inclined to follow the dominant faith of their peers.</p>\n<p>However, many changelings find a connection to the Traveler and live a life with less consistency and more chaos - almost as if the god of trickery and change guides them.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Names…</h2>\n<p>A changeling might use a different name for each mask and persona, and adopt new names as easily as they change faces. The true name of a changeling tends to be simple and monosyllabic. For changelings that share personas with their communities, there are often accents each individual changeling employs that is missed by the single-skins. Two changelings might both play the role of Amel, but one is Amel-with-vivid-blue-eyes and the other is Amel-with-golden-nails.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Changeling Names: Aunn, Bin, Cas, Dox, Fie, Hars, Jin, Lam, Mas, Nix, Ot, Paik, Ruz, Sim, Toox, Vil, Yug</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"note d-flex flex-wrap\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<div class=\"flex-even column\" data-markdown=\"1\">\n<h4 class=\"inline-header\" style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif);gap:var(--space-l)\"><br />See the Exploring Eberron entry on Changeling personas on pg. 34.<br /><br /></h4>\n<p style=\"margin-top:var(--space-s)\"> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"},"source":{"value":"PF2E for Eberron"},"traits":{"value":["hb_eberron-changelings","humanoid"],"rarity":"uncommon","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.812,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2023-01-06T12:55:46.828-05:00","version":{"schema":0.769,"foundry":"10.291","system":"4.6.3"}}},"hp":6,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["cha"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":1,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{"EgmJE":{"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e-for-eberron.pf2e-for-eberron-ancestry-features.nKa6IV40AKB9OHqa","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Shapeshifters","level":0}},"vision":"normal"},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.6.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1673027746832,"modifiedTime":1673031160929,"lastModifiedBy":"knTUi1bTspduSmIG"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"knTUi1bTspduSmIG":3}}
